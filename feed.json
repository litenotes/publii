            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    In the 1960s, the son of a winemaker worked in an administrative office in Germany.\n<br>His name is Niklas Luhmann. He doesn't like a lot of social activities, but focuses on reading after work, focusing on his different interests in philosophy, organizational theory and sociology.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    He invented a method of taking a note, followed by his interest, in the process of reading or living, whenever we met new insights or knowledge, he would record the information on a A6 card, put it in\nIn the slider.\nGive notes with numbers and indexes.\nHe is just relying on interest in the slider.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Until one day, he compiled a manuscript and gave it to Schelsky, the most influential German sociologist at the time.\nSchelsky was shocked by the layman's writing and wrote back directly recommending Luhmann to the university as a professor of sociology.\nLuhmann also quickly completed the thesis writing required by the professor with the help of the note-taking system, and began his own academic journey.\nDuring his later 30 years of academic career, he published 58 books and hundreds of articles, contributing new insights into social research topics such as economy, science, law, art and love.\nEven after his death, later generations published six or seven books on different topics such as religion, education or politics based on his note-taking system.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Later sociologists have done a lot of research on Luhmann's workflow and believe that his work efficiency is related to his unique way of working.\nThis technique is how Luhmann uses A6 paper to take notes and put them in a slider box.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For learners and knowledge workers, notes are not unfamiliar. They will take notes while reading, take notes in class, and take notes (draft paper) during exams.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    So, since everyone can take notes, what's so special about Luhmann's note-taking system?\n<br>How does the note-taking system help him to study better and improve his work efficiency?\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"how-can-notes-help-you-learn-better\">\n      How can notes help you learn better?\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The process of learning is the process of internalizing external information into knowledge in your own brain.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://litenotes.github.io/publii/media/posts/12/222.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://litenotes.github.io/publii/media/posts/12/responsive/222-xs.jpg 300w ,https://litenotes.github.io/publii/media/posts/12/responsive/222-sm.jpg 480w ,https://litenotes.github.io/publii/media/posts/12/responsive/222-md.jpg 768w ,https://litenotes.github.io/publii/media/posts/12/responsive/222-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://litenotes.github.io/publii/media/posts/12/responsive/222-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://litenotes.github.io/publii/media/posts/12/responsive/222-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  height=\"284\" width=\"1024\" alt=\"\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    The information we receive will be stored in our short-term memory.\nHowever, it takes understanding and memory to convert short-term memory into long-term memory, and the process is not simple.\nSo we need to take notes.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The first function of notes is to help us store information.\nRecord the information you have learned so that it can be easily read next time. Only through skillful repetition can the information be internalized into our knowledge.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The second function of notes is to help us think and understand information.\nWhen we are thinking, if what we are thinking is right in front of us, it will be much less convenient for us to think.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This is the third function of notes, which is to create links between knowledge and knowledge.\n<br>This is also the first feature of Luhmann's note-taking style.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The last step in knowledge learning is to output knowledge and influence others.\nHowever, new knowledge often occurs at the edge of the discipline, where the collision between knowledge and knowledge is the fiercest.\nLuhmann's note-taking method creates links between notes and notes, that is, to create more collisions between knowledge and knowledge.\nWhen we find that we have accumulated quite a lot of knowledge and connections under a certain topic, we can take the initiative to turn this topic into articles and spread the knowledge to influence more people.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In fact, our brain and note-taking system are complementary and cooperative in the process of learning.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The advantage of the brain lies in thinking, but the brain's attention and memory are limited.\n<br>The existence of the note-taking system just makes up for the shortcomings of the brain.\nThe note-taking system is primarily responsible for recording and storing information objectively and visualizing the relationship between knowledge and knowledge.\nIt is a resource of long-term memory.\nOn the other hand, the brain can focus its only attention and memory on deeper thinking and understanding, releasing the creativity of the brain.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"standardization-process-of-notes\">\n      Standardization Process of Notes\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The above part has already talked about the role of notes in the learning process.\nHowever, in the process of actual operation, the work of knowledge appears to be more complex.\nIn the face of complex things, the best way is to adopt a standardized process to standardize the operation.\nOnly when the process of writing notes is standardized, can all related work become a process related to the whole or part, the bottleneck of writing is eliminated, and significant changes can take place.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"1-take-short-notes\">\n      1. Take short notes\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    When a new idea comes up, simply write down the ideas you want to express, put them in the inbox (collection box), and deal with them later.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"2-take-documentary-notes\">\n      2. Take \"documentary notes\"\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    When reading, write down selectively what you don't want to forget, or what you think may be used in thinking and writing.\nIt is useless to simply write down sentences.\nA sentence or noun can only work in his context.\nTherefore, when we take notes, we can not simply copy and paste the knowledge, the key point is to use our own text to translate the information into a blank context.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    It needs to be emphasized that it is also a process of deliberate practice. Every time we take notes, we need to read, think, understand and extract information from the article and translate it into notes.\nThis kind of practice will not bring a faster learning speed, but it will help to improve our ability to summarize, extract and express information, and it is very helpful for both writing and speaking.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"3-take-permanent-notes\">\n      3. Take permanent notes\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Review the temporary notes and literature notes recorded during the previous period of time every day.\nAnd think about what they have to do with what you are studying or interested in.\n<br><strong>Does the new note contradict the old one?\n</strong><br><strong>Do you support or supplement the information you already have?\n<br>Can you combine ideas to create new problems or thoughts?</strong>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Every time I think about the relationship between notes and notes, I re-examine the past knowledge and revise my cognition by constantly adding new knowledge.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Then, use complete sentences, disclose your source, provide references, and try to be accurate, clear and short.\nThrow away the temporary notes from step 1 and put the notes from step 2 into your reference system.\nYou can forget them now.\nWhat is important is the permanent notes that enter the slider box.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"4-create-connections\">\n      4. Create connections\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Connect the notes that are directly related to the new permanent notes to create a connection.\n<br>Make sure you can find this note later!&nbsp;Or make a link to a new note in your notes that are an entry point for a discussion or topic.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    If you use paper notes, the process of creating connections will become very complex. Luhmann uses four kinds of links and indexes in paper notes to implement the process of creating connections.\nFor example, if note An is compiled as \"21\" and a content B directly related to the content of An is recorded after a period of time, the number of B can be set to \"21a\" and the two notes can be put together.\n<br>Now using note-taking software that supports \"two-way connections\", the process becomes very simple.\nIn such note-taking software, we only need to do two kinds of links:\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Use two-way links to create links between directly related notes.\nCreate an index that applies to notes that have been created under a topic.\nIndexing is achieved through the tag function in note-taking software, and we can create a tag for this topic to index this part of the content.\n<br>There are many skills in the use of indexes.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"5-follow-your-interests\">\n      5. Follow your interests\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Interest is the best mentor. Follow your own interests and add notes to the slider box.\nAs long as you are interested in a topic, you will actively read more and precipitate more.\nSo the book advises never to brainstorm aimlessly, but to observe what notes are available in the note-taking system.\nIdeas and innovations are generated in the connection between notes and notes.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"6-development-of-themes-and-writing\">\n      6. Development of themes and writing\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    When we see that we have accumulated more notes under a certain topic, we can actively spread out the notes on this topic to supplement the lack of knowledge points in the knowledge system.\nSystematically organize arguments and initially construct the order of sections, chapters, or paragraphs.\nTry to organize the text of multiple notes into linear articles.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"design-of-positive-feedback-loop\">\n      Design of positive feedback loop\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    People who are already in the habit of taking notes may feel that their original note-taking method is enough.\nPeople who are not used to taking notes may find it difficult to take time to take notes.\n<br>Taking notes is indeed a costly task. Zettelkasten note-taking system does not make us more efficient in reading or learning. On the contrary, it requires us to spend more time.\nOf course, you will learn more at the same time.\nWhat is even more surprising is that if you are a learner, Luhmann's note-taking method has a positive feedback loop effect.\nThis is why it is called a note-taking system rather than a simple note-taking method.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Its positive feedback comes from three aspects.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    1.Knowledge has network effect.\nAs we learn more and more knowledge, it is easier for us to find the connection between knowledge and knowledge. We can also better understand and remember knowledge based on existing knowledge, and make it easier for us to find new problems.\nIn other words, as more and more notes are recorded, there will be more connections between notes, and the cost of taking notes will become lower and lower.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    2.The profit feedback cycle of knowledge is very long, and human beings naturally like things that can be fed back in time (such as games).\nSo learning is quite anti-human and behavior.\nBut * * note-taking is actually a kind of immediate feedback on learning.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    3. Note-taking system and the positive progress of the brain, in the past, after we learn, the beneficiaries are only themselves.\nIn the cooperative mode between the brain and the note-taking system, as we grow, the note-taking system continues to grow.\nOn the other hand, the advantages of the brain and the note-taking system are omplementary, the brain is responsible for thinking and understanding, and the note-taking system is responsible for storing facts and connections.\nThe two make progress synchronously under the complementary cooperative relationship.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

You don't need to think as long as subjective questions.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For example, a study plan takes 1000 hours, 84 hours a month, 21 hours a week, just over 2 hours a day, according to the standard of one year. This kind of time can be saved by walking and taking a car.\nIf you want to learn and improve yourself, you should start with a 1000-hour study plan and make good use of your fragment time so that you will have at least 1000 more hours per year than others.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"bold-dont-be-afraid-of-exam\">\n      Bold, don't be afraid of exam\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The purpose of many studies is to take an examination and get a qualification certificate.\n<br>Since it is for the examination, why not first look at the examination questions and then look at the textbook, and then select the scope of review of the textbook according to the content of the exam, so that you can have a better grasp of the exam.\n<br>There are three steps here:\n<br>(1) first look at the exercise book;&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    (2) look at the answers to the exercise book;&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    (3) finally look at the textbook.\n<br>Start with output-oriented learning, don't do useless work, and win the exam with the least energy.\nTo see the workbook, you only need to look at the types of examination questions and the methods of answering questions over the years, and then read through the textbook.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    By using the reading method of \"ONE POCKET\", when you have too many textbooks and the test site is not just a textbook, you can write on the main textbook what is not on the main textbook, which not only reduces the number of textbooks to be carried during each review, but also makes full use of the textbook as a tool for collecting all the information.\nThe review of the textbook can use the Ebinghaus curve memory method to consolidate the memory of the materials in a scientific way.\nWhen the review time is insufficient, you can bet boldly and make a special analysis on the contents and types of examination questions over the years.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"fall-in-love-with-learning\">\n      Fall in love with learning\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Let learning become a habit in order to persist for a long time.

Find your most fundamental motivation in order to stimulate the domestic demand for your study.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    (2) Establish a mechanism for happy learning.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    After the motivation and mechanism have been determined, it is to establish \"visual\" learning, turning your learning level into information that can be clearly indicated in the data, to promote your learning, as if you are defeating your yesterday's self every day.\n<br>Learning is a long process, and if you don't have a visible goal to urge you, you will soon give up.\n<br>In addition to the supervision of visual learning methods, you can also find a learning partner, whether in the virtual network or in real life, there must be friends who work with you, even if they only have a common direction on a goal. helping each other in learning will be much better than a person's efforts.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"adjust-the-surrounding-environment-in-order-to-learn\">\n      Adjust the surrounding environment in order to learn\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Escape from the comfort zone, the so-called comfort zone is a person living in a certain area for a long time, leaving his own mark of life in the area, and his body and mind will be relaxed whenever he returns to this area.\nHome, bedroom and study are all examples of this kind.\nGet out of such an area and go to a strange place where you can't leave too many traces of people-libraries, study rooms, coffee shops and quiet places are all appropriate choices.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Escape from the comfort zone, the so-called comfort zone is a person living in a certain area for a long time, leaving his own mark of life in the area, and his body and mind will be relaxed whenever he returns to this area.\nHome, bedroom and study are all examples of this kind.\nGet out of such an area and go to a strange place where you can't leave too many traces of people-libraries, study rooms, coffee shops and quiet places are all appropriate choices.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Dimming the lights of the room, the dim environment makes it easier for people to focus on the lights.\nIt's like singers and stars in the spotlight, focusing on them for a moment.\nWhen you are distracted, try abdominal breathing-slowly remove the air from your body, inhale slowly, and concentrate several times.\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    First of all, we have to understand what effective reading is. You read a book, and the knowledge in the book becomes part of your cognitive system.\nSo how to test whether you have internalized the things in the book into your own things? the easiest way is to output what you have read. If you can output smoothly, then you must transform the knowledge into your own.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"1-set-a-goal\">\n      1. Set a goal\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    When it comes to setting goals, we need to have a goal in everything we do. if we don't have a goal, it's like sailing in the sea without a compass. You may not be able to walk around in the sea for months.\nNote: setting a goal must be something to think about before you start reading a book, just like determining your destination before you leave.\nThinking about your goals before reading a book can help you get twice the result with half the effort.\n<br>For example, if you want to read a romance novel, your goal can be to relax, or to learn the structure of the novel, as well as some writing techniques of the author. of course, it can also be the girl-flirting routine of learning romance novels and so on (I am not responsible for being beaten).\nThe focus of reading will be different with different goals.\nThat's why it's particularly important to set goals.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"2-environment\">\n      2. Environment\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    After setting your own goals, don't worry, you still need to find a suitable environment, what is the right environment, which varies from person to person, but most people need a quiet, warm and comfortable environment to sit and sit in a comfortable environment when reading.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    After choosing the environment, you have to make sure that the environment will not be disturbed, so it is best to sell the phone, and students who are reluctant to give up can also set the phone to do not disturb mode.\nPrevent someone from disturbing you when you are immersed in the ocean of knowledge.\nRemember not to lie down and read, not because you are nearsighted, but because it is easy to fall asleep when reading in bed. I tested the lark myself. When I couldn't sleep, I took an obscure book and read it for a few minutes. I dozed off and came uninvited.&nbsp;In short, what I do in choosing the environment is to make myself better concentrate so that I can read better.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"3-indepth-thinking\">\n      3. In-depth thinking\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Speaking of in-depth thinking, there are different opinions on this issue, because some people just stay on the surface, translate the meaning of the text, go through it like a movie in their minds, and then leave a blank at the end of the play.\nWhy do you forget anything after reading? because there is no deep thinking, no in-depth understanding of the article, it will naturally float on the surface, and then forget as if in the blink of an eye.\n<br>\n<br>So how to think deeply when reading a book? it should be combined with your own goal before you start reading, that is, why you want to read this book and what you want to gain after reading this book.\nTake the example of the romance novel above. If you just want to be happy, then you can think about what makes you happy in this book and how to find similar books next time.\nIf your goal is to learn the author's writing techniques, you should pay attention to where and what techniques the author uses when you read.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    When you think while reading a book, instead of swallowing it, you are really reading the book, communicating with the author's ideas, not swallowing it. Reading is not kung fu, but fast. What you need to read is to slow down and slowly understand the meaning conveyed in the book. Slow is fast.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"4-propose-a-problem\">\n      4. Propose a problem\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    If you do not ask a question, it means that you do not think seriously, you do not have doubts about the point of view that you do not agree with, that is, the so-called thousand readers have a thousand Hamlets, and the ideas of you and the author cannot be exactly the same. so it is inevitable that the author will have a different point of view, so when reading a book, there are bound to be more or less doubts, so in effective reading.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    We have to learn to catch these questions, and then with our own questions to find the answer, maybe you do not find the answer in this chapter, then you may find the question in the next chapter, or you may find the answer in another book.\nTaking a critical look at your own and other people's opinions will make it easier for you to find the problem.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"5-summary-and-review\">\n      5. Summary and review\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    After reading a book, there must be a summary and review, because people's short-term memory is limited, so they need to review in time, that is to say, to sum up what they have learned from reading this book in time, I recommend it once after reading a chapter. This can effectively prevent the battle line of a book from being too long, causing people to forget the previous one after reading the latter, so summarize it once after reading a chapter.\n<br>Can effectively prevent their own memory loss.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"6-mind-map\">\n      6. Mind map\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Do you think it will be over after the summary and review? no, what else do you need to do? write a mind map and why do you want to write this? it is to clarify the inner logic of the whole book, which can help you sublimate the content of the book.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"7-attempt-to-output\">\n      7. Attempt to output\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    After the previous operation, you can finally sharpen the knife to pigs and sheep, you have a detailed understanding of a book, you can try to output, to dedicate your knowledge to others.\n<br>Seriously, the output of knowledge is conducive to their own internalization, so do not be stingy with their own knowledge, oh, give up to have, spread knowledge to others, you will gain more.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"one-last-thingbr\">\n      One last thing.<br>\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    When reading, you should choose a book that suits you. Books that exceed your Rank are only suitable for use as hypnotic objects.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

Make a list and make a plan.\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    <strong>Step 1</strong>: think about which books you are interested in, which books (knowledge) you urgently need, and which are good for you.\nIf you can't find a book, the easiest way is to find someone to recommend it or search the Internet based on keywords.\n<br><strong>Step 2</strong>: make a list of books for yourself according to the first step, usually in years or months.\n<br><strong>Step 3</strong>: incorporate the book list into your reading plan, that is, what books you want to read each month, how much time you spend reading or how much you read each day.\nMake a table and post it in a conspicuous place (you can use a colored pen to make this reading schedule creatively).\n<br><strong>Step 4</strong>: put the books you want to read that day in the ready, on the desk and other places.\n<br>This will serve as a reminder to prevent you from forgetting or procrastinating again and again.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"2-from-shallow-to-deep-from-simple-to-complex\">\n      2. From shallow to deep, from simple to complex\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Many of us always overestimate our abilities, which is reflected in the fact that we have bought a lot of books, but very few of us have actually finished or read them.\nOne of the big reasons is that the selected books are higher than their own reading level, it is difficult to read, and slowly they lose interest.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In the matter of reading, don't aim too high at the beginning and choose books that are very heavy and difficult to understand, resulting in less and less interest in reading.\nYou should first choose books that are easy to read and easy to understand, and then wait until you have some foundation, and then step by step to read books that are more difficult on the same subject.\nIn fact, in every topic, there will be relatively simple and advanced books. Before you have a foundation, start with simple or interesting books.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"3-improve-reading-skills\">\n      3. Improve reading skills.\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    If you want to develop good reading habits and enjoy the benefits and fun of reading, it is necessary to learn and master some reading skills.\nThere are a lot of detailed reading skills, many of which have been taught by teachers at school, so here are just a few:\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    1) when reading, focus on the main contents and related arguments of each paragraph.\nWhen reading, use a pencil to draw notes and mark the key points of each paragraph, which also helps to improve your reading ability.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    2) when you encounter words and opinions that you don't understand in reading, don't look it up in the dictionary or look up the materials. You can contact the sentence before and after, or try to understand it in context, which is helpful to improve your reading and thinking ability.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    3) Train your ability of fast reading.This does not mean that you should have a reading speed of tens of thousands of words per minute. The key is to change your traditional word-by-word reading habits and improve your reading efficiency.\nBecause reading slowly word by word, not only the reading speed is slow, but also its comprehension rate is not high.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The focus of the training of fast reading method is to activate our \"brain and eye\" potential, and to cultivate a reading learning style of eye-brain direct reflection.\nNot to mention those great gods who count at a glance, as long as we ordinary people train consciously and read 5-10 words at a glance, everyone can easily master it.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    4) To understand a book from multiple angles.\nEveryone will be limited by their own knowledge structure, ability and other factors, when reading, they can only read and understand a book from the level closest to them.\nFor good books, there are generally a lot of comments and understanding of big V or celebrities online, or articles, books, or videos, explanations, might as well listen to their views.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"4-reading-and-writing-are-not-separated-writing-strengthens-reading-and-promotes-reading\">\n      4. Reading and writing are not separated. Writing strengthens reading and promotes reading.\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    <strong>Consolidate reading</strong>: after reading a book, or just a part of it, and then write about your understanding and perception after reading, even if it is just a simple reading style writing, you can further understand and master what you are reading.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <strong>Promote reading</strong>: when you need or want to write an article on a topic, in order to write better, you will flip through some books and materials related to the topic, which virtually urges you to read. and eventually form a virtuous circle.\nOn the other hand, sharing what you write will encourage you to continue reading and writing.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"5-integrate-reading-into-daily-life\">\n      5. Integrate reading into daily life\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    First of all, provide yourself with a suitable place to read.\nIf you live around a library and other places suitable for reading, it is best to feel more.\nIf not, it doesn't matter. Discover or create a place for reading on your own.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Second, Make good use of your mobile phone, read e-books through your mobile phone, and excellent articles, all of which will increase your reading ability.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In addition, you can also organize your own family and friends to participate in reading and share the fun and harvest of reading.\n  </p>",

But if you want to show it to others, simply explaining the process can be confusing to the reader. Because everyone has different knowledge reserves and different ways of thinking, forcing readers to understand the article according to our way of thinking makes it feel like \"Hello, I am your father\".<br>The clear structure of the article is that the author collates his own ideas and presents them in a way that readers can understand. At the top of the pyramid is the central idea behind the  article. Ideally the content of the lower layer is carried out layer by layer, and the content of the lower layer is a detailed discussion of the content of the upper layer, and the content of the upper layer is a summary of the content of the lower layer. This structure is in line with the basic principles of human cognition, making it is easier for readers to understand the structure of the human brain.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"pyramids-are-a-way-to-organize-content\">\n      Pyramids are a way to organize content\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    There are horizontal and vertical relations throughout the pyramid structure. At the top of the pyramid is the core idea of the whole article. And then on the next level, the pyramid is simply a way to organize content from top to bottom.<br>There are horizontal and vertical relations throughout the pyramid structure.<br>In the vertical relationship, the upper thought is the summary of the lower layer, while the lower thought is the explanation of the upper layer, and the top layer is the theme of the whole article, followed by the explanation of the theme, and then the further explanation of the details.<br>In the horizontal relationship, each thought is an explanation to the upper level, and the content also belongs to the same category. For example, in this article, the  core idea is \"how to use the pyramid principle to write a good article\", and then on the second layer, which you see now, is to discuss the core idea of the pyramid principle and how to use it to write a good article. Several key points discussed include \"what is a good article\", \"what is the pyramid principle\", \"why to use the pyramid principle\" and \"how to use the pyramid principle\".\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"pyramid-structure-makes-the-article-easier-to-understandbr\">\n      Pyramid structure makes the article easier to understand<br>\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    There are two ways in which we first perceive things, one is from the top down, and the other is from the bottom up.Usually we first use a top-down approach to identify things.Suppose you are in the computer city and see something beautiful thing in the showcase of a store that you have never seen before.You know you are in the computer city, so you can see that the business scope of this store is digital products, so you can conclude that this thing is a digital product.You'll be attracted to it, want to learn more, and eventually realize that this is a new router.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This is the basic process of human recognition of things, and we will first try to understand things macroscopically, and then explore these things in detail.The pyramid principle is such a top-down structure that readers are the first to come into contact with the topic of the article in the process of reading, which limits the scope of the article, helps readers determine the direction of thinking, and  readers  the content of the article. in order to better understand the article more quickly and accurately.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"build-a-pyramid-structure-before-writing\">\n      Build a pyramid structure before writing\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Before you actually write an article, you need to sort out the pyramid structure of the article, usually using a top-down approach to building the pyramid structure:\n  </p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Write out the theme of the article.</li><li>Raise questions in the reader's mind.</li><li>If you have an answer, answer the question.</li><li>Write out the background.</li><li>Point out the conflict.</li><li>Check whether the question is valid to prevent the topic from deviating.</li><li>Readers will ask new questions about the answer.</li><li>Determine whether to use deduction or induction to answer new questions.</li><li>Repeat steps 7 and 8.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n    <h5 id=\"what-are-deduction-and-induction\">\n      What are deduction and induction?\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    The deductive method is in the same layer of the pyramid, which is discussed horizontally according to the logical order or chronological order, and finally uses \"therefore\" to get the result.\nThe upper layer of deductive reasoning is a summary of the deductive process, with emphasis on the conclusion after \"therefore\".\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Induction is a horizontal summary of the common characteristics of each thought, from which to draw a conclusion. There is a certain jump between the conclusion and each thought, so the inductive method is more difficult to use than the deductive method, it needs to be analyzed in combination with a variety of situations, and the author's position and collected information will have an impact on the final conclusion.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <strong>Generally speaking, in the higher level of the article, the inductive method is used, while in the lower level, the deductive method is used.</strong>\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"present-the-pyramid-structure-in-the-article\">\n      Present the pyramid structure in the article\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Structure is the skeleton of the article, which plays a good guiding role in the subsequent writing process.The whole writing process is equivalent to supplementing the pyramid structure by making it fuller.The beginning of the article is at the top of the pyramid.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"the-preface-is-the-top-of-the-pyramid\">\n      The preface is the top of the pyramid.\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    We should have a good idea of the preface before writing the text.\nThe preface is the beginning of an article and the top of the pyramid structure.\nA good preface allows readers to quickly understand what the article is going to discuss.\nThe purpose of the preface is to explain the background clearly, which leads to the central idea.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The preface is the prelude to an article, giving an account of the causes and consequences of the matter, that is, an introduction to the background.\nThen the introduction of conflict, we can understand the background as the introduction of the status quo and goals, and conflict is the gap between the status quo and goals.\nWhen a conflict occurs, readers generally ask questions about it, such as \"so what now?\"\n\"if you already have a ready-made solution, then give the reader solution.\nThe text of the article is to discuss the solution, \"Why do you do this\" and \"what should be done\".\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"the-background-is-to-tell-stories\">\n      The background is to tell stories.\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    The preface usually starts with the background, and the best way to explain the background is to tell a story.\nThe story is generally easy to understand and does not need the reader to think. At the same time, it can make the reader recall his own experience and become interested in the article.\nThe story should revolve around the theme, and at the same time, it should be true and credible, so as to prevent readers from asking questions that are different from the main ideas in the preface.\nJoin me to write an article on \"how to import iPhone photos into Mac\". In the preface, readers should avoid asking questions such as \"Why should iPhone be used?\"\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"conflict-is-about-asking-questionsbr\">\n      Conflict is about asking questions<br>\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    After explaining the background clearly, it will lead to conflict.\nConflict is the gap between reality and ideal, and the purpose of conflict is to make readers ask questions.\nSome articles also introduce conflicts in front of the background, which usually does not have a good solution in order to highlight the author's concerns.\nAs in the order of building a pyramid, the questions raised by the reader, if they already have an answer, should also be included in the preface.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"the-text-is-the-main-body-of-the-pyramid\">\n      The text is the main body of the pyramid\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    After reading the preface, the reader will ask a series of questions about the questions and solutions in the preface.\nUsually these questions focus on \"what is\", \"why\" and \"how to do it\". These questions are to be answered in the text.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    It is common to use multi-level headings to present the pyramid structure in the text.\n<br>The title should not only show the structure of the article, but more importantly, let the reader have some expectations for the next content.\nSo the title usually uses simple and clear language to summarize the points to be discussed next.\nFor example, in this article, the title of \"Why to use the Pyramid principle\" is \"the Pyramid principle makes the article easier to understand\", which directly presents the reason, so that the reader can be prepared for the next content.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This is the pyramid structure used in writing this article, using multi-level headings to show what the pyramid principle is, \"why\" and \"how to do it\". The revised title also shows the reader the point of view discussed later. the low-level title answers the questions that the reader may ask when reading the upper content.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"let-the-reader-take-action-at-the-endbr\">\n      Let the reader take action at the end<br>\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    In theory, an article with a pyramid structure doesn't need to end, but it may make the reader feel a little sudden about the sudden ending. The ending should make readers feel a need and desire to take action. We should give the reader hints as to what he should think about and what he can do after reading the article and gaining new knowledge. <br>\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Last year, I read very little, it is really a shame. But the reason for the lack of reading, one is too busy while two is gradually finding the \"not reading\" benefits.. In fact, during the “No reading”year, I thought more about reading..\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"should-i-read-a-book\">\n      Should I read a book?\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    You’d think the answer to that question would be “Yes,” but the truth is, I don’t have enough reason to convince you to read. Personally, the “Should” question doesn’t exist, but if I answer it intellectually, the answer is still -- yes.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Here’s why:\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"1reading-is-the-best-way-for-an-individual-to-acquire-knowledge\">\n      1)Reading is the best way for an individual to acquire knowledge\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    A good book, especially an introduction to a certain field, covers most of the classic contents of a certain discipline system. It is precisely because classic, comprehensive, introduction books are the only way for a person to enter a certain discipline, and the construction of this system can not be replaced by film and television materials or other channels, which is called \"the best way\".\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"2reading-is-the-most-economical-way-for-individuals-to-acquire-knowledge\">\n      2)Reading is the most economical way for individuals to acquire knowledge.\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    In terms of price, if a book does not pursue binding design and pay attention to the content alone, the price is really not very expensive. A dozen cheap books, some slightly more expensive books, and even some slightly luxurious books can be said to be \"economical\" in exchange for \"knowledge\" at such a price.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"3reading-is-the-fastest-way-for-an-individual-to-acquire-knowledge\">\n      3)Reading is the fastest way for an individual to acquire knowledge.\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    This can be seen from the comparison between reading and other ways. When a person wants to understand a certain field of knowledge, if he relies on listening to books and watching movies, he must spend no less time than it takes to finish reading a book. This can also be said to be \"the economy of time\". In addition, the human brain is willing to accept colorful and dynamic stimuli, but it is not easy to accept the single stimulus of words. Therefore, if the content in a certain field is presented by image or film and television, it may be easier to accept, but it can only leave a superficial impression, but at first it takes more time to digest, while books are not. because the text itself is \"monotonous and boring\", the digestion of the content is accompanied by the whole process of reading, and the impression you get after reading a book must not be limited to one line of words and one sentence, but the whole content is understood.<br>The <mark><strong>three reasons</strong></mark> I give are \"personal\" and clearly point out the benefits of \"acquiring knowledge\".\nSo, if you need to acquire knowledge in a certain field, then don't hesitate, you should read.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But at the same time, it must be pointed out that in my opinion, although reading is a \"should\" thing to do, reading is also a dangerous activity.\nTherefore, the person who indiscriminately recommends everyone to read all books, even if he is a scholar, must be doubtful.\nYou know, the nourishment of a good book may last a lifetime, while a bad book may be poisonous for a lifetime.\nOf course, the views on good books and bad books vary from time to time, which involves a certain value judgment, which will not be discussed in detail here.\nBut in the situation of \"the whole people do not read\", what is more important than the question of \"good books and bad books\" is, which book is the most suitable for you?\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In short, if you want to acquire knowledge in a certain field, read!\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"is-it-necessary-to-read\">\n      Is it necessary to read?\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    <mark>In my opinion, reading is something that \"should be done\" but \"not necessary\" for everyone to do.&nbsp;</mark>Even if a thing should be done, you may not have to do it. On the other hand, even if a thing should not be done, you may not necessarily not do it.\n<br>For example: according to the ethics of public places, each of us should give up our seat to the weak on the bus, but we may not do so. Conversely, no one should run a red light, but you will occasionally run it under certain circumstances.\n<br>It's the same with reading.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The unnecessary reason is simple:\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>1)Everyone has limited time and can only do the most important things.\n</em></strong><br>If reading does not keep you alive and will take up a lot of your time, then it is more reasonable to spend your time on \"survival\".&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>2)Reading is not the only way to acquire knowledge.\n</em></strong><br>It may be the best, most economical and most convenient way to acquire knowledge (this is just my opinion), but it is not irreplaceable and certainly suitable for you.\nThe era we live in is called the \"<mark>digital age</mark>\". There are not only words, but also speeches, podcasts, videos, VR, AR and so on.\nCompared with words, pictorial knowledge is also easier for us to accept, more vivid and interesting, so is there any reason why they can't replace \"reading\"?\nIn addition, every kind of knowledge must have its most suitable way to acquire, reading is only one of these ways, in most cases is not the most suitable one.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>3)Reading is not the only way to get the best emotional experience.\n</em></strong><br>One of my propositions is that if reading doesn't give people a good emotional experience, it's better not to read at all.\nOf course, the \"happiness\" I'm talking about here is only one of the emotional experiences, and the reading process may be accompanied by pain, satisfaction, boredom, anger and other emotions.\nSo how do you define this \"good emotional experience\"?\n<br>Are pain and anger \"good\"?\nMaybe we should take into account what we think of as negative emotions.\nGenerally speaking, in the process of reading the novel, the reader's emotional experience will be very obvious, especially the type of novel whose plot is particularly attractive (martial arts, science fiction, romance, etc.). This kind of emotional fluctuation is normal in the process of reading. and the novel itself has the function of emotional catharsis, so is part of the purpose of the author's own creation.\nBut in this era, \"fast food culture\" often gives people a greater impact, so that people get emotional experience in a variety of ways, \"fast-paced\" way of life brings people a fast-paced emotional experience.\nFor example, we can temporarily get rid of the world and immerse ourselves in the ups and downs of the movie, and then pull it out, while reading is a kind of \"slow work\", which takes more time, obviously unable to meet people's \"fast\" needs.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Saying that \"reading is something that should be done but does not need everyone to do\" does not mean that I do not advocate reading. Reading is irreplaceable in obtaining a longer-term emotional experience, sharpening the mind and exercising the mind.\n<br>I still remember the pleasure of immersing myself in the the pleasure of reading martial arts novels all night. I also remember the scene when I was fascinated by the video games when I was a child, but now people may be more impressed by video games. As far as emotions are concerned, there may be no difference, but in terms of ability improvement, it can only be said that \"each has his own strengths\".\n<br>A good game is better than a good book, but it can't completely replace the good book (on the contrary), because the game is loose and real-time, and the book is tight and permanent.\n<br>On the contrary, some games can help people improve their spatial cognitive ability, and most books can't do that.\nThis is also one of the reasons why reading is \"unnecessary\".\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"how-to-read-a-book\">\n      How to read a book?\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The experience of our predecessors may be useful for reference, but it is not a day to develop reading habits and methods. Moreover, the books read by the ancients are different from those we read now, and there is no need to blindly copy them.\n<br>Therefore, my opinion is that different methods should be used to read different types of books, and the method of reading should change with the purpose of reading.\n<br>For example, reading social science and reading novels should adopt different reading methods, reading social science, focusing on acquiring new knowledge, so we need to take steps to capture the ideas and logic in the article, while reading novels, focusing on reading experience, should be as fast as the wind, immersed in it, aftertaste, aftertaste, aftertaste.\n<br>In addition, although they are both reading novels, the reading methods of ordinary readers are certainly different from those of professional researchers. as mentioned earlier, ordinary readers do not pursue an in-depth analysis of the structure and thought of the novel, while the researchers are not. in the understanding of the novel as a whole, we should also \"divide the novel into pieces\" and carefully examine the details such as the logic of the development of the story and the shaping of characters.\n<br>This is my personal experience, that is, you don't have to stick to the same method in reading.\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "<h2>1. Continuously maintain high quality input</h2>\n<p>I recall that when I first wrote, I sat in front of the computer, scratching my ear and scratching my cheek, and I didn't know how to write. In the final analysis, my stomach had too little \"ink\" to hold the literati. Less \"ink\" means we don't have enough input. <br>Input is like the inlet of a reservoir. Only by keeping a continuous supply of input can there be a continuous flow of output. Input and output is a complete closed loop. <br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #3598db;\"><em>So what are inputs and outputs? </em></span><br>What you hear, what you learn, what you see can be called input, and what you write and say can be called output. We usually read books, read articles is a kind of input, communicate with people, get new ideas and methods, these are also a kind of input. <br>Even what you see and hear during the journey, the new things you come into contact with, is also a kind of input. <br>For example, when I read books and read other people's articles, I will encounter some golden sentences, stories and cases; chat with friends, classmates and strangers, talk about good methods, new ideas, and desirable places. I will write down, accumulate more, collect more, organize more, absorb more, and internalize more. <br>In writing, when you encounter the right topic, you can sort it out and use it, which can not only make the content of the article appear lively and interesting, but also enrich the content, so that the whole article will not be full of our own stories, so that it will be written out in less than a few times. <br>For good methods, I will also practice and experience more deeply. This is a typical use of input and output. Only by insisting on self-knowledge input and integrating into one's own practice can we make these common principles more attractive and more persuasive when they are passed on to everyone. Readers are also more willing to accept, resonate, make changes, and take action.</p>\n<h2>2.Writing should think carefully, improve the depth and highlight the novelty</h2>\n<p>Writing is the process of expressing ideas in words, and the words you write are the crystallization of your thinking. If your brain is empty, no matter how good your writing skills are, you can only moan without illness. The point you think out is the soul of the article. The clearer you think, the clearer you can write. A profound article comes from deep thinking. <br>There are many writers now, and when you think of a point, many Daniel writers may have written it already. No matter how good you are, it is very difficult to stand out, because when readers go to see the big names, your reading volume and attention will naturally be less. <br>When writing, you can first go to the platform or the web to search for similar topics or articles, if there is already a particularly good one, then continue to think about the theme to avoid bumping into shirts and homogenizing content. <br>Want to scarce themes or ideas and perspectives are relatively \"new\". <br>There are two methods that can be used. <br><em><strong>1) the exclusion method of three-tier thinking. </strong></em><br>Is to face a subject, the first layer of thinking to think of a theme, and then think of the second, and then think hard back, until come up with a new point of view. <br><strong><em>2) the method of multi-angle observation of the same subject matter. </em></strong><br>Try to analyze it from different angles, for example, excellent movies will have a lot of reviews, and everyone will cut into different angles, and the effect will be different. These are all materials for us to learn. <br>Then how to improve their thinking ability, introduce several methods, are very easy to use. <br><em><strong>1) when you encounter anything, ask yourself a few more \"why\".</strong></em></p>\n<p>When you were a child, when you encounter something, we always like to ask a lot of why. Later, we all grew up, a lot of things, our thinking is only on the surface, no longer want to ask why, gradually, we are too lazy to think. <br>For a writer, we should constantly ask ourselves \"why\", dig deeper, explore the truth, pursue the deepest thoughts, force ourselves to think, and pursue the origin of things. <br><strong><em>2) A4 paper brainstorming</em></strong><br>Take a minute to write down your thoughts on A4 paper. <br>Write down the topic you want to express on each piece of paper, write 4-6 lines on a page, 20-30 words on each line, and limit the time to one minute. <br>The way to do this is to quickly focus your attention and arouse your thoughts. <br>Long-term training can easily improve the ability of deep thinking. <br><strong><em>3) use the golden circle of thinking. </em></strong><br>The way we look at problems is divided into three levels. <br><strong>The first level</strong> is the what level, that is, the appearance of things, everything we do. <br><strong>The second level </strong>is the how level, that is, how we achieve what we want to do. <br><strong>The third level </strong>is the why level, which is why we do such things. <br>The most basic application of the golden circle of thinking is: when you encounter everything, you must first ask \"why\" in order to know what to do and what to do. For example, when you write, you must first think about \"why you want to write\". Only by thinking clearly about why can you have the motivation to continue to write. <br>We should develop the habit of asking why when solving problems, and do things from the beginning to the end. If you slowly develop this habit of thinking, you will grow and gain from anything, and the effect of this ability is the most frightening and amazing.</p>\n<h2>3.Continuously improve writing skills.</h2>\n<p>Writing is also a skill, it takes deliberate practice to make perfect, every writing is an exercise, every time reading other people's articles, dismantling the writing methods of other people's articles, is a kind of learning. <br>Novices usually not only have to study other people's excellent works, imitate and learn; on the other hand, they should start to write boldly. Only when they really write, can they have a chance to write better and better; they can also specialize in reading books to improve their writing skills in an all-round way. <br><span style=\"color: #3598db;\"><strong>Write more and change more. </strong></span><br>If you write less, your brain will not live; if you change less, you will not be able to express clearly. You can also read relevant writing books about improving your writing skills. I recommend that I have read several books that have a great influence on me.</p>",

If you knock yourself to death in any mode, you are doing useless work.</span></strong></address>\n<p><span class=\"text-dst\"><strong>Focused mode</strong>: your brain is mainly learning, entering information, and doing information matching work. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">It is usually started when we are working and studying.</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\"><strong>Diffuse mode</strong>: your brain is doing internal analysis, generating new links, re-linking and kneading old knowledge. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">This state is initiated when we sleep, exercise and other relaxed states. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Sometimes you have inspiration when you take a shower, and that's what this pattern does.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-dst\"> To sum up, it is necessary to stop and play after studying for a period of time. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">It's not laziness, but only in this way, your brain works most efficiently.</span></p>\n<h2>Procrastination is normal</h2>\n<p><span class=\"text-dst\">According to scientists, when we encounter something we don't like or something very difficult, the brain secretes a special substance that makes you feel uncomfortable. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Then it naturally encourages you to focus on other things, and you procrastinate. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-dst\">So, first of all, you have to know that procrastination is a normal human behavior, so don't blame yourself too much. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-dst\">What are we going to do with it? </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Our brains also have a magical function, that is, once you focus on a task for more than five minutes, this particular substance will stop secreting. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">So the solution to doing unhappy things is to force yourself to start for five minutes, and then everything will be fine.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"text-dst\">About memory. </span></h2>\n<address><strong><span class=\"text-dst\">The content needs to be repeated constantly, and the higher the previous repetition frequency, the longer the memory will be preserved</span></strong></address>\n<p><span class=\"text-dst\">Which of the following ways can achieve a better and faster memory effect if you want to remember a poem?</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\"><strong>A</strong> memorize over 20 times a day.</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\"><strong>B</strong> recite 10 times on the first day, 5 times on the second day, and 5 times on the 4th day.</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\">The answer is <strong>B. </strong></span><span class=\"text-dst\">Because memory is divided into <strong>short-term memory</strong> and<strong> long-term memory</strong>, the way to convert short-term memory into long-term memory is to repeat over a period of time, rather than one at a time.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"textpanel-source active\"><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;\">Sleep is a magic weapon that can make you smarter</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"text-dst\">What are our brains doing while we sleep?</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\">1. Clean up the garbage secretions produced by heavy exercise during the day.</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\">2. Reorganize the information entered during the day, classify them and re-link them. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Suppose the brain is a large cabinet with many drawers, and the large amount of information entered during the day is like all kinds of things that have just been bought. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">After going to bed at night, the brain classifies these things into various drawers one by one, so that you can use them later.</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\">3. Strengthen the link between new knowledge and old knowledge, and subconsciously keep thinking about the problems that have not been solved during the day. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">The most important thing is that these movements can only be done during sleep, so sleep is really an important task.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"text-dst\">To build a strong framework, you need two things, Chunking and Connecting</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"text-dst\"><strong>Chunking</strong>, the knowledge we take in every day, like building bricks in a house, is independent. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">If you want to build a house, you must have enough bricks, so it is necessary to learn all kinds of information.</span><span class=\"text-dst\"> To build a house, you also need cement to connect these bricks. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">This requires that every time you learn a knowledge, you should think about the causes and consequences of this knowledge, what are the rules, and so on.</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\"><strong>Connecting</strong>, you will have the ability to innovate. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Because you can find a pattern in the connection of each small module. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Then as you have more and more connections and become more and more powerful, there will be more possibilities for connections. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">The ability to innovate is coming.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"text-dst hl\">What to do when you need to learn something difficult</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"text-dst\">First, if you need to learn something that is difficult,, don't focus on the results, enjoy the process. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Paying too much attention to the result will make you give up.</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\">The second is to give yourself periodic rewards, which is very important. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Proper self-discipline is freedom, and excessive self-discipline is self-harm. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Your respect for human nature, respect for the nature of your brain, and a reward from time to time will make it easier for you to stick to it. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">The interval between rewards should not be too long. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">For example, if you lose weight for 5 days, you can eat freely; after 2 hours of homework, you can play with your cell phone for 10 minutes. After this reward, you are full of energy.</span><br><span class=\"text-dst\">Third, believe in yourself and don't blame yourself all the time. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">As long as this time is a little better than last time, it will be all right. </span><span class=\"text-dst\">Of course, if it's not good once in a while, it doesn't matter, it's better next time.</span></p>",
