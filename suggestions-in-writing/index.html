Continuously maintain high quality input</h2><p>I recall that when I first wrote, I sat in front of the computer, scratching my ear and scratching my cheek, and I didn't know how to write. In the final analysis, my stomach had too little "ink" to hold the literati. Less "ink" means we don't have enough input. <br>Input is like the inlet of a reservoir. Only by keeping a continuous supply of input can there be a continuous flow of output. Input and output is a complete closed loop. <br><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #3598db;"><em>So what are inputs and outputs? </em></span><br>What you hear, what you learn, what you see can be called input, and what you write and say can be called output. We usually read books, read articles is a kind of input, communicate with people, get new ideas and methods, these are also a kind of input. <br>Even what you see and hear during the journey, the new things you come into contact with, is also a kind of input. <br>For example, when I read books and read other people's articles, I will encounter some golden sentences, stories and cases; chat with friends, classmates and strangers, talk about good methods, new ideas, and desirable places. I will write down, accumulate more, collect more, organize more, absorb more, and internalize more. <br>In writing, when you encounter the right topic, you can sort it out and use it, which can not only make the content of the article appear lively and interesting, but also enrich the content, so that the whole article will not be full of our own stories, so that it will be written out in less than a few times. <br>For good methods, I will also practice and experience more deeply. This is a typical use of input and output. Only by insisting on self-knowledge input and integrating into one's own practice can we make these common principles more attractive and more persuasive when they are passed on to everyone. Readers are also more willing to accept, resonate, make changes, and take action.</p><h2>2.Writing should think carefully, improve the depth and highlight the novelty</h2><p>Writing is the process of expressing ideas in words, and the words you write are the crystallization of your thinking. If your brain is empty, no matter how good your writing skills are, you can only moan without illness. The point you think out is the soul of the article. The clearer you think, the clearer you can write. A profound article comes from deep thinking. <br>There are many writers now, and when you think of a point, many Daniel writers may have written it already. No matter how good you are, it is very difficult to stand out, because when readers go to see the big names, your reading volume and attention will naturally be less. <br>When writing, you can first go to the platform or the web to search for similar topics or articles, if there is already a particularly good one, then continue to think about the theme to avoid bumping into shirts and homogenizing content. <br>Want to scarce themes or ideas and perspectives are relatively "new". <br>There are two methods that can be used. <br><em><strong>1) the exclusion method of three-tier thinking. </strong></em><br>Is to face a subject, the first layer of thinking to think of a theme, and then think of the second, and then think hard back, until come up with a new point of view. <br><strong><em>2) the method of multi-angle observation of the same subject matter. </em></strong><br>Try to analyze it from different angles, for example, excellent movies will have a lot of reviews, and everyone will cut into different angles, and the effect will be different. These are all materials for us to learn. <br>Then how to improve their thinking ability, introduce several methods, are very easy to use. <br><em><strong>1) when you encounter anything, ask yourself a few more "why".</strong></em></p><p>When you were a child, when you encounter something, we always like to ask a lot of why. Later, we all grew up, a lot of things, our thinking is only on the surface, no longer want to ask why, gradually, we are too lazy to think. <br>For a writer, we should constantly ask ourselves "why", dig deeper, explore the truth, pursue the deepest thoughts, force ourselves to think, and pursue the origin of things. <br><strong><em>2) A4 paper brainstorming</em></strong><br>Take a minute to write down your thoughts on A4 paper. <br>Write down the topic you want to express on each piece of paper, write 4-6 lines on a page, 20-30 words on each line, and limit the time to one minute. <br>The way to do this is to quickly focus your attention and arouse your thoughts. <br>Long-term training can easily improve the ability of deep thinking. <br><strong><em>3) use the golden circle of thinking. </em></strong><br>The way we look at problems is divided into three levels. <br><strong>The first level</strong> is the what level, that is, the appearance of things, everything we do. <br><strong>The second level </strong>is the how level, that is, how we achieve what we want to do. <br><strong>The third level </strong>is the why level, which is why we do such things. <br>The most basic application of the golden circle of thinking is: when you encounter everything, you must first ask "why" in order to know what to do and what to do. For example, when you write, you must first think about "why you want to write". Only by thinking clearly about why can you have the motivation to continue to write. <br>We should develop the habit of asking why when solving problems, and do things from the beginning to the end. If you slowly develop this habit of thinking, you will grow and gain from anything, and the effect of this ability is the most frightening and amazing.</p><h2>3.Continuously improve writing skills.</h2><p>Writing is also a skill, it takes deliberate practice to make perfect, every writing is an exercise, every time reading other people's articles, dismantling the writing methods of other people's articles, is a kind of learning. <br>Novices usually not only have to study other people's excellent works, imitate and learn; on the other hand, they should start to write boldly. Only when they really write, can they have a chance to write better and better; they can also specialize in reading books to improve their writing skills in an all-round way. <br><span style="color: #3598db;"><strong>Write more and change more. </strong></span><br>If you write less, your brain will not live; if you change less, you will not be able to express clearly. You can also read relevant writing books about improving your writing skills. I recommend that I have read several books that have a great influence on me.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 29, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://notelism.com/tags/writing/">Writing</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://notelism.com/get-rid-of-the-following-five-misunderstandings-and-you-will-make-progress-faster/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Get rid of the following five misunderstandings, and you will make progress faster</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://notelism.com/about-reading/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> About Reading </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>CopyRight © 2021 notelism</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
