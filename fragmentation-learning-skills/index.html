Cloud Drive can be used to store learning materials, and the utilization rate of online disks has gradually increased in recent years.</p><h2 id="concentrate-the-fragmented-time">Concentrate the fragmented time</h2><p>During the period of school, each of us has at least ten hours of study, but after work, such a large area of time still does not exist.<br>This requires changing your mindset, learning how to concentrate for a short time, and learning to use your time while waiting for a bus, running, or walking.<br>"Learning at the same time" is the core of the thinking of the text, taking advantage of its own lack of time to make good use of the work that requires the use of manual labor.<br>For example, study while eating, half an hour for breakfast, one hour for lunch and dinner, two and a half hours for rational use.<br>During this period of time, you can memorize words, practice listening or read some multiple-choice questions. You don't need to think as long as subjective questions.</p><p>For example, a study plan takes 1000 hours, 84 hours a month, 21 hours a week, just over 2 hours a day, according to the standard of one year. This kind of time can be saved by walking and taking a car. If you want to learn and improve yourself, you should start with a 1000-hour study plan and make good use of your fragment time so that you will have at least 1000 more hours per year than others.</p><h2 id="bold-dont-be-afraid-of-exam">Bold, don't be afraid of exam</h2><p>The purpose of many studies is to take an examination and get a qualification certificate.<br>Since it is for the examination, why not first look at the examination questions and then look at the textbook, and then select the scope of review of the textbook according to the content of the exam, so that you can have a better grasp of the exam.<br>There are three steps here:<br>(1) first look at the exercise book;&nbsp;</p><p>(2) look at the answers to the exercise book;&nbsp;</p><p>(3) finally look at the textbook.<br>Start with output-oriented learning, don't do useless work, and win the exam with the least energy. To see the workbook, you only need to look at the types of examination questions and the methods of answering questions over the years, and then read through the textbook.</p><p>By using the reading method of "ONE POCKET", when you have too many textbooks and the test site is not just a textbook, you can write on the main textbook what is not on the main textbook, which not only reduces the number of textbooks to be carried during each review, but also makes full use of the textbook as a tool for collecting all the information. The review of the textbook can use the Ebinghaus curve memory method to consolidate the memory of the materials in a scientific way. When the review time is insufficient, you can bet boldly and make a special analysis on the contents and types of examination questions over the years.</p><h2 id="fall-in-love-with-learning">Fall in love with learning</h2><p>Let learning become a habit in order to persist for a long time. When learning becomes a habit, you can learn independently without perseverance and cultivate habits from two aspects:&nbsp;</p><p>(1) find motivation for learning. Find your most fundamental motivation in order to stimulate the domestic demand for your study.</p><p>(2) Establish a mechanism for happy learning.</p><p>After the motivation and mechanism have been determined, it is to establish "visual" learning, turning your learning level into information that can be clearly indicated in the data, to promote your learning, as if you are defeating your yesterday's self every day.<br>Learning is a long process, and if you don't have a visible goal to urge you, you will soon give up.<br>In addition to the supervision of visual learning methods, you can also find a learning partner, whether in the virtual network or in real life, there must be friends who work with you, even if they only have a common direction on a goal. helping each other in learning will be much better than a person's efforts.</p><h2 id="adjust-the-surrounding-environment-in-order-to-learn">Adjust the surrounding environment in order to learn</h2><p>Escape from the comfort zone, the so-called comfort zone is a person living in a certain area for a long time, leaving his own mark of life in the area, and his body and mind will be relaxed whenever he returns to this area. Home, bedroom and study are all examples of this kind. Get out of such an area and go to a strange place where you can't leave too many traces of people-libraries, study rooms, coffee shops and quiet places are all appropriate choices.</p><p>Escape from the comfort zone, the so-called comfort zone is a person living in a certain area for a long time, leaving his own mark of life in the area, and his body and mind will be relaxed whenever he returns to this area.

It's like singers and stars in the spotlight, focusing on them for a moment. When you are distracted, try abdominal breathing-slowly remove the air from your body, inhale slowly, and concentrate several times.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 5, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://notelism.com/how-to-read-effectively/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How to read effectively</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://notelism.com/use-zettelkasten-to-help-with-learning/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Use Zettelkasten to help with learning </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-05-05T22:36" class="feed__date">May 5, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://notelism.com/use-zettelkasten-to-help-with-learning/" class="invert">Use Zettelkasten to help with learning</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>CopyRight © 2021 notelism</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
