But if you want to show it to others, simply explaining the process can be confusing to the reader. Because everyone has different knowledge reserves and different ways of thinking, forcing readers to understand the article according to our way of thinking makes it feel like "Hello, I am your father".<br>The clear structure of the article is that the author collates his own ideas and presents them in a way that readers can understand. At the top of the pyramid is the central idea behind the article. Ideally the content of the lower layer is carried out layer by layer, and the content of the lower layer is a detailed discussion of the content of the upper layer, and the content of the upper layer is a summary of the content of the lower layer. This structure is in line with the basic principles of human cognition, making it is easier for readers to understand the structure of the human brain.</p><h2 id="pyramids-are-a-way-to-organize-content">Pyramids are a way to organize content</h2><p>There are horizontal and vertical relations throughout the pyramid structure. At the top of the pyramid is the core idea of the whole article. And then on the next level, the pyramid is simply a way to organize content from top to bottom.<br>There are horizontal and vertical relations throughout the pyramid structure.<br>In the vertical relationship, the upper thought is the summary of the lower layer, while the lower thought is the explanation of the upper layer, and the top layer is the theme of the whole article, followed by the explanation of the theme, and then the further explanation of the details.<br>In the horizontal relationship, each thought is an explanation to the upper level, and the content also belongs to the same category. For example, in this article, the core idea is "how to use the pyramid principle to write a good article", and then on the second layer, which you see now, is to discuss the core idea of the pyramid principle and how to use it to write a good article. Several key points discussed include "what is a good article", "what is the pyramid principle", "why to use the pyramid principle" and "how to use the pyramid principle".</p><h2 id="pyramid-structure-makes-the-article-easier-to-understandbr">Pyramid structure makes the article easier to understand<br></h2><p>There are two ways in which we first perceive things, one is from the top down, and the other is from the bottom up.Usually we first use a top-down approach to identify things.Suppose you are in the computer city and see something beautiful thing in the showcase of a store that you have never seen before.You know you are in the computer city, so you can see that the business scope of this store is digital products, so you can conclude that this thing is a digital product.You'll be attracted to it, want to learn more, and eventually realize that this is a new router.</p><p>This is the basic process of human recognition of things, and we will first try to understand things macroscopically, and then explore these things in detail.The pyramid principle is such a top-down structure that readers are the first to come into contact with the topic of the article in the process of reading, which limits the scope of the article, helps readers determine the direction of thinking, and readers the content of the article. in order to better understand the article more quickly and accurately.</p><h2 id="build-a-pyramid-structure-before-writing">Build a pyramid structure before writing</h2><p>Before you actually write an article, you need to sort out the pyramid structure of the article, usually using a top-down approach to building the pyramid structure:</p><ol><li>Write out the theme of the article.</li><li>Raise questions in the reader's mind.</li><li>If you have an answer, answer the question.</li><li>Write out the background.</li><li>Point out the conflict.</li><li>Check whether the question is valid to prevent the topic from deviating.</li><li>Readers will ask new questions about the answer.</li><li>Determine whether to use deduction or induction to answer new questions.</li><li>Repeat steps 7 and 8.</li></ol><h5 id="what-are-deduction-and-induction">What are deduction and induction?</h5><p>The deductive method is in the same layer of the pyramid, which is discussed horizontally according to the logical order or chronological order, and finally uses "therefore" to get the result. The upper layer of deductive reasoning is a summary of the deductive process, with emphasis on the conclusion after "therefore".</p><p>Induction is a horizontal summary of the common characteristics of each thought, from which to draw a conclusion. There is a certain jump between the conclusion and each thought, so the inductive method is more difficult to use than the deductive method, it needs to be analyzed in combination with a variety of situations, and the author's position and collected information will have an impact on the final conclusion.</p><p><strong>Generally speaking, in the higher level of the article, the inductive method is used, while in the lower level, the deductive method is used.</strong></p><h2 id="present-the-pyramid-structure-in-the-article">Present the pyramid structure in the article</h2><p>Structure is the skeleton of the article, which plays a good guiding role in the subsequent writing process.The whole writing process is equivalent to supplementing the pyramid structure by making it fuller.The beginning of the article is at the top of the pyramid.</p><h5 id="the-preface-is-the-top-of-the-pyramid">The preface is the top of the pyramid.</h5><p>We should have a good idea of the preface before writing the text. The preface is the beginning of an article and the top of the pyramid structure. A good preface allows readers to quickly understand what the article is going to discuss. The purpose of the preface is to explain the background clearly, which leads to the central idea.</p><p>The preface is the prelude to an article, giving an account of the causes and consequences of the matter, that is, an introduction to the background. Then the introduction of conflict, we can understand the background as the introduction of the status quo and goals, and conflict is the gap between the status quo and goals. When a conflict occurs, readers generally ask questions about it, such as "so what now?" "if you already have a ready-made solution, then give the reader solution. The text of the article is to discuss the solution, "Why do you do this" and "what should be done".</p><h5 id="the-background-is-to-tell-stories">The background is to tell stories.</h5><p>The preface usually starts with the background, and the best way to explain the background is to tell a story. The story is generally easy to understand and does not need the reader to think. At the same time, it can make the reader recall his own experience and become interested in the article. The story should revolve around the theme, and at the same time, it should be true and credible, so as to prevent readers from asking questions that are different from the main ideas in the preface. Join me to write an article on "how to import iPhone photos into Mac". In the preface, readers should avoid asking questions such as "Why should iPhone be used?"</p><h5 id="conflict-is-about-asking-questionsbr">Conflict is about asking questions<br></h5><p>After explaining the background clearly, it will lead to conflict. Conflict is the gap between reality and ideal, and the purpose of conflict is to make readers ask questions. Some articles also introduce conflicts in front of the background, which usually does not have a good solution in order to highlight the author's concerns. As in the order of building a pyramid, the questions raised by the reader, if they already have an answer, should also be included in the preface.</p><h5 id="the-text-is-the-main-body-of-the-pyramid">The text is the main body of the pyramid</h5><p>After reading the preface, the reader will ask a series of questions about the questions and solutions in the preface. Usually these questions focus on "what is", "why" and "how to do it". These questions are to be answered in the text.</p><p>It is common to use multi-level headings to present the pyramid structure in the text.<br>The title should not only show the structure of the article, but more importantly, let the reader have some expectations for the next content. So the title usually uses simple and clear language to summarize the points to be discussed next. For example, in this article, the title of "Why to use the Pyramid principle" is "the Pyramid principle makes the article easier to understand", which directly presents the reason, so that the reader can be prepared for the next content.</p><p>This is the pyramid structure used in writing this article, using multi-level headings to show what the pyramid principle is, "why" and "how to do it". The revised title also shows the reader the point of view discussed later. the low-level title answers the questions that the reader may ask when reading the upper content.</p><h5 id="let-the-reader-take-action-at-the-endbr">Let the reader take action at the end<br></h5><p>In theory, an article with a pyramid structure doesn't need to end, but it may make the reader feel a little sudden about the sudden ending. The ending should make readers feel a need and desire to take action. We should give the reader hints as to what he should think about and what he can do after reading the article and gaining new knowledge.<br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 30, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/tags/study/">Study</a></li><li><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/tags/writing/">Writing</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/about-reading/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> About Reading</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/five-effective-ways-to-cultivate-good-reading-habits/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Five effective ways to cultivate good Reading habits </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-30T22:34" class="feed__date">April 30, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/five-effective-ways-to-cultivate-good-reading-habits/" class="invert">Five effective ways to cultivate good Reading habits</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>CopyRight © 2021 notelism</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
