This kind of behavior will raise their own "excitement threshold", making people less and less likely to have a sense of achievement, thus relying more and more on a virtual sense of achievement and falling into a vicious circle.&nbsp;</p><p>Mild symptoms:&nbsp;"addicted to games" (speeding up the passage of time in the virtual world, so that "success" comes faster), "stallion novels" (obscene people can easily get what they want);</p><p>Serious symptoms and even illegal: gambling" (easy access to "money"), "drug abuse" (easy to get the feeling of "cool"), and so on.</p><h2 id="only-receive-sources-with-low-information-densitynbsp">Only receive sources with "low information density"&nbsp;</h2><p>Only willing to receive information with low information density (such as videos and pictures that do not need too much brainstorming, as well as shallow entertainment, gossip, sports news, etc.). Do not want to receive information with high information density and can only be absorbed after careful consideration (such as courses, knowledge frameworks, analytical reports, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Since most of the really valuable and progressive information needs to be considered and digested, it will not be possible to make progress without in-depth study and understanding.</p><h2 id="get-used-to-paralyzing-yourself-with-a-sense-of-misplaced-achievement">Get used to paralyzing yourself with a sense of "misplaced achievement"</h2><p><br>There are two categories: first, compare your strengths with other people's weaknesses, so as to get the illusion of "better than others" (for example, compared with athletes, and high achiever compared with sports); second, when others are resting after serious work, pretend to work harder (for example, "show off" that you have done more work than others on holidays, but only on holidays).</p><h2 id="overreliance-on-existing-feasible-paths">Over-reliance on "existing feasible paths"</h2><p>At work, after getting used to the process of a thing, I never think about how to improve it. I will only repeat it mechanically, and then deceive myself to be full. If there is no improvement, there is no consciousness of getting rid of dross, so there are more and more things that need to be repeated and take longer and longer. in the end, it seems that a lot of things have been done every day, but in fact, there is not only no progress at all. the time of progress that should have been made is also wasted.</p><h2 id="close-the-channel-of-reinforcement-learning">Close the channel of "reinforcement learning"</h2><p>In learning or receiving information, you are only willing to perform the simplest first step, but are unwilling to carry out the next more complex consolidation and application process, only listening without speaking, reading without writing, learning without practice, and paralyzing yourself by saying that you have learned a lot. In fact, this kind of "shallow" learning forgets so quickly that sometimes it is better not to learn at all. For example, learn English every day, but never write English articles.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 29, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://notelism.com/tags/progress/">Progress</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://notelism.com/how-to-learn-faster/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How to learn faster?</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://notelism.com/suggestions-in-writing/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Suggestions in writing </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-30T22:34" class="feed__date">April 30, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://notelism.com/five-effective-ways-to-cultivate-good-reading-habits/" class="invert">Five effective ways to cultivate good Reading habits</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-29T10:56" class="feed__date">April 29, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://notelism.com/how-to-learn-faster/" class="invert">How to learn faster?</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>CopyRight Â© 2021 notelism</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
