But the reason for the lack of reading, one is too busy while two is gradually finding the "not reading" benefits.. In fact, during the “No reading”year, I thought more about reading..</p><p></p><h2 id="should-i-read-a-book">Should I read a book?</h2><p>You’d think the answer to that question would be “Yes,” but the truth is, I don’t have enough reason to convince you to read. Personally, the “Should” question doesn’t exist, but if I answer it intellectually, the answer is still -- yes.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s why:</p><h5 id="1reading-is-the-best-way-for-an-individual-to-acquire-knowledge">1)Reading is the best way for an individual to acquire knowledge</h5><p>A good book, especially an introduction to a certain field, covers most of the classic contents of a certain discipline system. It is precisely because classic, comprehensive, introduction books are the only way for a person to enter a certain discipline, and the construction of this system can not be replaced by film and television materials or other channels, which is called "the best way".</p><h5 id="2reading-is-the-most-economical-way-for-individuals-to-acquire-knowledge">2)Reading is the most economical way for individuals to acquire knowledge.</h5><p>In terms of price, if a book does not pursue binding design and pay attention to the content alone, the price is really not very expensive. A dozen cheap books, some slightly more expensive books, and even some slightly luxurious books can be said to be "economical" in exchange for "knowledge" at such a price.</p><h5 id="3reading-is-the-fastest-way-for-an-individual-to-acquire-knowledge">3)Reading is the fastest way for an individual to acquire knowledge.</h5><p>This can be seen from the comparison between reading and other ways. When a person wants to understand a certain field of knowledge, if he relies on listening to books and watching movies, he must spend no less time than it takes to finish reading a book. This can also be said to be "the economy of time". In addition, the human brain is willing to accept colorful and dynamic stimuli, but it is not easy to accept the single stimulus of words. Therefore, if the content in a certain field is presented by image or film and television, it may be easier to accept, but it can only leave a superficial impression, but at first it takes more time to digest, while books are not. because the text itself is "monotonous and boring", the digestion of the content is accompanied by the whole process of reading, and the impression you get after reading a book must not be limited to one line of words and one sentence, but the whole content is understood.<br>The <mark><strong>three reasons</strong></mark> I give are "personal" and clearly point out the benefits of "acquiring knowledge". So, if you need to acquire knowledge in a certain field, then don't hesitate, you should read.</p><p>But at the same time, it must be pointed out that in my opinion, although reading is a "should" thing to do, reading is also a dangerous activity. Therefore, the person who indiscriminately recommends everyone to read all books, even if he is a scholar, must be doubtful. You know, the nourishment of a good book may last a lifetime, while a bad book may be poisonous for a lifetime. Of course, the views on good books and bad books vary from time to time, which involves a certain value judgment, which will not be discussed in detail here. But in the situation of "the whole people do not read", what is more important than the question of "good books and bad books" is, which book is the most suitable for you?</p><p>In short, if you want to acquire knowledge in a certain field, read!</p><h2 id="is-it-necessary-to-read">Is it necessary to read?</h2><p><mark>In my opinion, reading is something that "should be done" but "not necessary" for everyone to do.&nbsp;</mark>Even if a thing should be done, you may not have to do it. On the other hand, even if a thing should not be done, you may not necessarily not do it.<br>For example: according to the ethics of public places, each of us should give up our seat to the weak on the bus, but we may not do so. Conversely, no one should run a red light, but you will occasionally run it under certain circumstances.<br>It's the same with reading.</p><p>The unnecessary reason is simple:</p><p><strong><em>1)Everyone has limited time and can only do the most important things.</em></strong><br>If reading does not keep you alive and will take up a lot of your time, then it is more reasonable to spend your time on "survival".&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>2)Reading is not the only way to acquire knowledge.</em></strong><br>It may be the best, most economical and most convenient way to acquire knowledge (this is just my opinion), but it is not irreplaceable and certainly suitable for you. The era we live in is called the "<mark>digital age</mark>". There are not only words, but also speeches, podcasts, videos, VR, AR and so on. Compared with words, pictorial knowledge is also easier for us to accept, more vivid and interesting, so is there any reason why they can't replace "reading"? In addition, every kind of knowledge must have its most suitable way to acquire, reading is only one of these ways, in most cases is not the most suitable one.</p><p><strong><em>3)Reading is not the only way to get the best emotional experience.</em></strong><br>One of my propositions is that if reading doesn't give people a good emotional experience, it's better not to read at all. Of course, the "happiness" I'm talking about here is only one of the emotional experiences, and the reading process may be accompanied by pain, satisfaction, boredom, anger and other emotions. So how do you define this "good emotional experience"?<br>Are pain and anger "good"? Maybe we should take into account what we think of as negative emotions. Generally speaking, in the process of reading the novel, the reader's emotional experience will be very obvious, especially the type of novel whose plot is particularly attractive (martial arts, science fiction, romance, etc.). This kind of emotional fluctuation is normal in the process of reading. and the novel itself has the function of emotional catharsis, so is part of the purpose of the author's own creation. But in this era, "fast food culture" often gives people a greater impact, so that people get emotional experience in a variety of ways, "fast-paced" way of life brings people a fast-paced emotional experience. For example, we can temporarily get rid of the world and immerse ourselves in the ups and downs of the movie, and then pull it out, while reading is a kind of "slow work", which takes more time, obviously unable to meet people's "fast" needs.</p><p>Saying that "reading is something that should be done but does not need everyone to do" does not mean that I do not advocate reading. Reading is irreplaceable in obtaining a longer-term emotional experience, sharpening the mind and exercising the mind.<br>I still remember the pleasure of immersing myself in the the pleasure of reading martial arts novels all night. I also remember the scene when I was fascinated by the video games when I was a child, but now people may be more impressed by video games. As far as emotions are concerned, there may be no difference, but in terms of ability improvement, it can only be said that "each has his own strengths".<br>A good game is better than a good book, but it can't completely replace the good book (on the contrary), because the game is loose and real-time, and the book is tight and permanent.<br>On the contrary, some games can help people improve their spatial cognitive ability, and most books can't do that. This is also one of the reasons why reading is "unnecessary".</p><h2 id="how-to-read-a-book">How to read a book?</h2><p>The experience of our predecessors may be useful for reference, but it is not a day to develop reading habits and methods. Moreover, the books read by the ancients are different from those we read now, and there is no need to blindly copy them.<br>Therefore, my opinion is that different methods should be used to read different types of books, and the method of reading should change with the purpose of reading.<br>For example, reading social science and reading novels should adopt different reading methods, reading social science, focusing on acquiring new knowledge, so we need to take steps to capture the ideas and logic in the article, while reading novels, focusing on reading experience, should be as fast as the wind, immersed in it, aftertaste, aftertaste, aftertaste.<br>In addition, although they are both reading novels, the reading methods of ordinary readers are certainly different from those of professional researchers. as mentioned earlier, ordinary readers do not pursue an in-depth analysis of the structure and thought of the novel, while the researchers are not. in the understanding of the novel as a whole, we should also "divide the novel into pieces" and carefully examine the details such as the logic of the development of the story and the shaping of characters.<br>This is my personal experience, that is, you don't have to stick to the same method in reading.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 30, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/tags/reading/">Reading</a></li><li><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/tags/study/">Study</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/suggestions-in-writing/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Suggestions in writing</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/using-the-pyramid-principle-to-write-a-good-article/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Using the pyramid principle to write a good article </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-30T22:34" class="feed__date">April 30, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/five-effective-ways-to-cultivate-good-reading-habits/" class="invert">Five effective ways to cultivate good Reading habits</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>CopyRight © 2021 notelism</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
