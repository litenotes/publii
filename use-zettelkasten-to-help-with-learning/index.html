He doesn't like a lot of social activities, but focuses on reading after work, focusing on his different interests in philosophy, organizational theory and sociology.</p><p>He invented a method of taking a note, followed by his interest, in the process of reading or living, whenever we met new insights or knowledge, he would record the information on a A6 card, put it in In the slider. Give notes with numbers and indexes. He is just relying on interest in the slider.</p><p>Until one day, he compiled a manuscript and gave it to Schelsky, the most influential German sociologist at the time. Schelsky was shocked by the layman's writing and wrote back directly recommending Luhmann to the university as a professor of sociology. Luhmann also quickly completed the thesis writing required by the professor with the help of the note-taking system, and began his own academic journey. During his later 30 years of academic career, he published 58 books and hundreds of articles, contributing new insights into social research topics such as economy, science, law, art and love. Even after his death, later generations published six or seven books on different topics such as religion, education or politics based on his note-taking system.</p><p>Later sociologists have done a lot of research on Luhmann's workflow and believe that his work efficiency is related to his unique way of working. This technique is how Luhmann uses A6 paper to take notes and put them in a slider box.</p><p>For learners and knowledge workers, notes are not unfamiliar. They will take notes while reading, take notes in class, and take notes (draft paper) during exams.</p><p>So, since everyone can take notes, what's so special about Luhmann's note-taking system?<br>How does the note-taking system help him to study better and improve his work efficiency?</p><h2 id="how-can-notes-help-you-learn-better">How can notes help you learn better?</h2><p>The process of learning is the process of internalizing external information into knowledge in your own brain.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://notelism.com/media/posts/12/222.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://notelism.com/media/posts/12/responsive/222-xs.jpg 300w, https://notelism.com/media/posts/12/responsive/222-sm.jpg 480w, https://notelism.com/media/posts/12/responsive/222-md.jpg 768w, https://notelism.com/media/posts/12/responsive/222-lg.jpg 1024w, https://notelism.com/media/posts/12/responsive/222-xl.jpg 1360w, https://notelism.com/media/posts/12/responsive/222-2xl.jpg 1600w" height="284" width="1024" alt=""></figure><p>The information we receive will be stored in our short-term memory. However, it takes understanding and memory to convert short-term memory into long-term memory, and the process is not simple. So we need to take notes.</p><p>The first function of notes is to help us store information. Record the information you have learned so that it can be easily read next time. Only through skillful repetition can the information be internalized into our knowledge.</p><p>The second function of notes is to help us think and understand information. When we are thinking, if what we are thinking is right in front of us, it will be much less convenient for us to think.</p><p>This is the third function of notes, which is to create links between knowledge and knowledge.<br>This is also the first feature of Luhmann's note-taking style.</p><p>The last step in knowledge learning is to output knowledge and influence others. However, new knowledge often occurs at the edge of the discipline, where the collision between knowledge and knowledge is the fiercest. Luhmann's note-taking method creates links between notes and notes, that is, to create more collisions between knowledge and knowledge. When we find that we have accumulated quite a lot of knowledge and connections under a certain topic, we can take the initiative to turn this topic into articles and spread the knowledge to influence more people.</p><p>In fact, our brain and note-taking system are complementary and cooperative in the process of learning.</p><p>The advantage of the brain lies in thinking, but the brain's attention and memory are limited.<br>The existence of the note-taking system just makes up for the shortcomings of the brain. The note-taking system is primarily responsible for recording and storing information objectively and visualizing the relationship between knowledge and knowledge. It is a resource of long-term memory. On the other hand, the brain can focus its only attention and memory on deeper thinking and understanding, releasing the creativity of the brain.</p><h2 id="standardization-process-of-notes">Standardization Process of Notes</h2><p>The above part has already talked about the role of notes in the learning process. However, in the process of actual operation, the work of knowledge appears to be more complex. In the face of complex things, the best way is to adopt a standardized process to standardize the operation. Only when the process of writing notes is standardized, can all related work become a process related to the whole or part, the bottleneck of writing is eliminated, and significant changes can take place.</p><h5 id="1-take-short-notes">1. Take short notes</h5><p>When a new idea comes up, simply write down the ideas you want to express, put them in the inbox (collection box), and deal with them later.</p><h5 id="2-take-documentary-notes">2. Take "documentary notes"</h5><p>When reading, write down selectively what you don't want to forget, or what you think may be used in thinking and writing. It is useless to simply write down sentences. A sentence or noun can only work in his context. Therefore, when we take notes, we can not simply copy and paste the knowledge, the key point is to use our own text to translate the information into a blank context.</p><p>It needs to be emphasized that it is also a process of deliberate practice. Every time we take notes, we need to read, think, understand and extract information from the article and translate it into notes. This kind of practice will not bring a faster learning speed, but it will help to improve our ability to summarize, extract and express information, and it is very helpful for both writing and speaking.</p><h5 id="3-take-permanent-notes">3. Take permanent notes</h5><p>Review the temporary notes and literature notes recorded during the previous period of time every day. And think about what they have to do with what you are studying or interested in.<br><strong>Does the new note contradict the old one?</strong><br><strong>Do you support or supplement the information you already have?<br>Can you combine ideas to create new problems or thoughts?</strong></p><p>Every time I think about the relationship between notes and notes, I re-examine the past knowledge and revise my cognition by constantly adding new knowledge.</p><p>Then, use complete sentences, disclose your source, provide references, and try to be accurate, clear and short. Throw away the temporary notes from step 1 and put the notes from step 2 into your reference system. You can forget them now. What is important is the permanent notes that enter the slider box.</p><h5 id="4-create-connections">4. Create connections</h5><p>Connect the notes that are directly related to the new permanent notes to create a connection.<br>Make sure you can find this note later!&nbsp;Or make a link to a new note in your notes that are an entry point for a discussion or topic.</p><p>If you use paper notes, the process of creating connections will become very complex. Luhmann uses four kinds of links and indexes in paper notes to implement the process of creating connections. For example, if note An is compiled as "21" and a content B directly related to the content of An is recorded after a period of time, the number of B can be set to "21a" and the two notes can be put together.<br>Now using note-taking software that supports "two-way connections", the process becomes very simple. In such note-taking software, we only need to do two kinds of links:</p><p>Use two-way links to create links between directly related notes. Create an index that applies to notes that have been created under a topic. Indexing is achieved through the tag function in note-taking software, and we can create a tag for this topic to index this part of the content.<br>There are many skills in the use of indexes.</p><h5 id="5-follow-your-interests">5. Follow your interests</h5><p>Interest is the best mentor. Follow your own interests and add notes to the slider box. As long as you are interested in a topic, you will actively read more and precipitate more. So the book advises never to brainstorm aimlessly, but to observe what notes are available in the note-taking system. Ideas and innovations are generated in the connection between notes and notes.</p><h5 id="6-development-of-themes-and-writing">6. Development of themes and writing</h5><p>When we see that we have accumulated more notes under a certain topic, we can actively spread out the notes on this topic to supplement the lack of knowledge points in the knowledge system. Systematically organize arguments and initially construct the order of sections, chapters, or paragraphs. Try to organize the text of multiple notes into linear articles.</p><h2 id="design-of-positive-feedback-loop">Design of positive feedback loop</h2><p>People who are already in the habit of taking notes may feel that their original note-taking method is enough. People who are not used to taking notes may find it difficult to take time to take notes.<br>Taking notes is indeed a costly task. Zettelkasten note-taking system does not make us more efficient in reading or learning. On the contrary, it requires us to spend more time. Of course, you will learn more at the same time. What is even more surprising is that if you are a learner, Luhmann's note-taking method has a positive feedback loop effect. This is why it is called a note-taking system rather than a simple note-taking method.</p><p>Its positive feedback comes from three aspects.</p><p>1.Knowledge has network effect. As we learn more and more knowledge, it is easier for us to find the connection between knowledge and knowledge. We can also better understand and remember knowledge based on existing knowledge, and make it easier for us to find new problems. In other words, as more and more notes are recorded, there will be more connections between notes, and the cost of taking notes will become lower and lower.</p><p>2.The profit feedback cycle of knowledge is very long, and human beings naturally like things that can be fed back in time (such as games). So learning is quite anti-human and behavior. But * * note-taking is actually a kind of immediate feedback on learning.</p><p>3. Note-taking system and the positive progress of the brain, in the past, after we learn, the beneficiaries are only themselves. In the cooperative mode between the brain and the note-taking system, as we grow, the note-taking system continues to grow. On the other hand, the advantages of the brain and the note-taking system are omplementary, the brain is responsible for thinking and understanding, and the note-taking system is responsible for storing facts and connections. The two make progress synchronously under the complementary cooperative relationship.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 5, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://notelism.com/fragmentation-learning-skills/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Fragmentation learning skills</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-05-05T21:11" class="feed__date">May 5, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://notelism.com/fragmentation-learning-skills/" class="invert">Fragmentation learning skills</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>CopyRight © 2021 notelism</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
