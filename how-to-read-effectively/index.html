You read a book, and the knowledge in the book becomes part of your cognitive system. So how to test whether you have internalized the things in the book into your own things? the easiest way is to output what you have read. If you can output smoothly, then you must transform the knowledge into your own.</p><h2 id="1-set-a-goal">1. Set a goal</h2><p>When it comes to setting goals, we need to have a goal in everything we do. if we don't have a goal, it's like sailing in the sea without a compass. You may not be able to walk around in the sea for months. Note: setting a goal must be something to think about before you start reading a book, just like determining your destination before you leave. Thinking about your goals before reading a book can help you get twice the result with half the effort.<br>For example, if you want to read a romance novel, your goal can be to relax, or to learn the structure of the novel, as well as some writing techniques of the author. of course, it can also be the girl-flirting routine of learning romance novels and so on (I am not responsible for being beaten). The focus of reading will be different with different goals. That's why it's particularly important to set goals.</p><h2 id="2-environment">2. Environment</h2><p>After setting your own goals, don't worry, you still need to find a suitable environment, what is the right environment, which varies from person to person, but most people need a quiet, warm and comfortable environment to sit and sit in a comfortable environment when reading.&nbsp;</p><p>After choosing the environment, you have to make sure that the environment will not be disturbed, so it is best to sell the phone, and students who are reluctant to give up can also set the phone to do not disturb mode. Prevent someone from disturbing you when you are immersed in the ocean of knowledge. Remember not to lie down and read, not because you are nearsighted, but because it is easy to fall asleep when reading in bed. I tested the lark myself. When I couldn't sleep, I took an obscure book and read it for a few minutes. I dozed off and came uninvited.&nbsp;In short, what I do in choosing the environment is to make myself better concentrate so that I can read better.</p><h2 id="3-indepth-thinking">3. In-depth thinking</h2><p>Speaking of in-depth thinking, there are different opinions on this issue, because some people just stay on the surface, translate the meaning of the text, go through it like a movie in their minds, and then leave a blank at the end of the play. Why do you forget anything after reading? because there is no deep thinking, no in-depth understanding of the article, it will naturally float on the surface, and then forget as if in the blink of an eye.<br><br>So how to think deeply when reading a book? it should be combined with your own goal before you start reading, that is, why you want to read this book and what you want to gain after reading this book. Take the example of the romance novel above. If you just want to be happy, then you can think about what makes you happy in this book and how to find similar books next time. If your goal is to learn the author's writing techniques, you should pay attention to where and what techniques the author uses when you read.</p><p>When you think while reading a book, instead of swallowing it, you are really reading the book, communicating with the author's ideas, not swallowing it. Reading is not kung fu, but fast. What you need to read is to slow down and slowly understand the meaning conveyed in the book. Slow is fast.</p><h2 id="4-propose-a-problem">4. Propose a problem</h2><p>If you do not ask a question, it means that you do not think seriously, you do not have doubts about the point of view that you do not agree with, that is, the so-called thousand readers have a thousand Hamlets, and the ideas of you and the author cannot be exactly the same. so it is inevitable that the author will have a different point of view, so when reading a book, there are bound to be more or less doubts, so in effective reading.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to learn to catch these questions, and then with our own questions to find the answer, maybe you do not find the answer in this chapter, then you may find the question in the next chapter, or you may find the answer in another book. Taking a critical look at your own and other people's opinions will make it easier for you to find the problem.</p><h2 id="5-summary-and-review">5. Summary and review</h2><p>After reading a book, there must be a summary and review, because people's short-term memory is limited, so they need to review in time, that is to say, to sum up what they have learned from reading this book in time, I recommend it once after reading a chapter. This can effectively prevent the battle line of a book from being too long, causing people to forget the previous one after reading the latter, so summarize it once after reading a chapter.<br>Can effectively prevent their own memory loss.</p><h2 id="6-mind-map">6. Mind map</h2><p>Do you think it will be over after the summary and review? no, what else do you need to do? write a mind map and why do you want to write this? it is to clarify the inner logic of the whole book, which can help you sublimate the content of the book.</p><h2 id="7-attempt-to-output">7. Attempt to output</h2><p>After the previous operation, you can finally sharpen the knife to pigs and sheep, you have a detailed understanding of a book, you can try to output, to dedicate your knowledge to others.<br>Seriously, the output of knowledge is conducive to their own internalization, so do not be stingy with their own knowledge, oh, give up to have, spread knowledge to others, you will gain more.</p><h2 id="one-last-thingbr">One last thing.<br></h2><p>When reading, you should choose a book that suits you. Books that exceed your Rank are only suitable for use as hypnotic objects.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 30, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://notelism.com/tags/reading/">Reading</a></li><li><a href="https://notelism.com/tags/study/">Study</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://notelism.com/five-effective-ways-to-cultivate-good-reading-habits/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Five effective ways to cultivate good Reading habits</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-30T22:34" class="feed__date">April 30, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://notelism.com/five-effective-ways-to-cultivate-good-reading-habits/" class="invert">Five effective ways to cultivate good Reading habits</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-30T10:18" class="feed__date">April 30, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://notelism.com/about-reading/" class="invert">About Reading</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>CopyRight © 2021 notelism</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
