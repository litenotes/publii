    Last year, I read very little, it is really a shame. But the reason for the lack of reading, one is too busy, two is gradually found the “Not reading”benefits. In fact, during the “No reading”year, I thought more about reading..
  </p>

    <h2 id="should-i-read-a-book">
      Should I read a book?
    </h2>

  <p>
    You’d think the answer to that question would be “Yes,” but the truth is, I don’t have enough reason to convince you to read. Personally, the “Should” question doesn’t exist, but if I answer it intellectually, the answer is still -- yes.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    Here’s why:
  </p>

    <h5 id="1reading-is-the-best-way-for-an-individual-to-acquire-knowledge">
      1)Reading is the best way for an individual to acquire knowledge
    </h5>

  <p>
    A good book, especially an introduction to a certain field, covers most of the classic contents of a certain discipline system. It is precisely because classic, comprehensive, introduction books are the only way for a person to enter a certain discipline, and the construction of this system can not be replaced by film and television materials or other channels, which is called "the best way".
  </p>

    <h5 id="2reading-is-the-most-economical-way-for-individuals-to-acquire-knowledge">
      2)Reading is the most economical way for individuals to acquire knowledge.
    </h5>

  <p>
    In terms of price, if a book does not pursue binding design and pay attention to the content alone, the price is really not very expensive. A dozen cheap books, some slightly more expensive books, and even some slightly luxurious books can be said to be "economical" in exchange for "knowledge" at such a price.
  </p>

    <h5 id="3reading-is-the-fastest-way-for-an-individual-to-acquire-knowledge">
      3)Reading is the fastest way for an individual to acquire knowledge.
    </h5>

  <p>
    This can be seen from the comparison between reading and other ways. When a person wants to understand a certain field of knowledge, if he relies on listening to books and watching movies, he must spend no less time than it takes to finish reading a book. This can also be said to be "the economy of time". In addition, the human brain is willing to accept colorful and dynamic stimuli, but it is not easy to accept the single stimulus of words. Therefore, if the content in a certain field is presented by image or film and television, it may be easier to accept, but it can only leave a superficial impression, but at first it takes more time to digest, while books are not. because the text itself is "monotonous and boring", the digestion of the content is accompanied by the whole process of reading, and the impression you get after reading a book must not be limited to one line of words and one sentence, but the whole content is understood.<br>The <mark><strong>three reasons</strong></mark> I give are "personal" and clearly point out the benefits of "acquiring knowledge".
So, if you need to acquire knowledge in a certain field, then don't hesitate, you should read.
  </p>

  <p>
    But at the same time, it must be pointed out that in my opinion, although reading is a "should" thing to do, reading is also a dangerous activity.
Therefore, the person who indiscriminately recommends everyone to read all books, even if he is a scholar, must be doubtful.
You know, the nourishment of a good book may last a lifetime, while a bad book may be poisonous for a lifetime.
Of course, the views on good books and bad books vary from time to time, which involves a certain value judgment, which will not be discussed in detail here.
But in the situation of "the whole people do not read", what is more important than the question of "good books and bad books" is, which book is the most suitable for you?
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, if you want to acquire knowledge in a certain field, read!
  </p>

    <h2 id="is-it-necessary-to-read">
      Is it necessary to read?
    </h2>

  <p>
    <mark>In my opinion, reading is something that "should be done" but "not necessary" for everyone to do.&nbsp;</mark>Even if a thing should be done, you may not have to do it. On the other hand, even if a thing should not be done, you may not necessarily not do it.
<br>For example: according to the ethics of public places, each of us should give up our seat to the weak on the bus, but we may not do so. Conversely, no one should run a red light, but you will occasionally run it under certain circumstances.
<br>It's the same with reading.
  </p>

  <p>
    The unnecessary reason is simple:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><em>1)Everyone has limited time and can only do the most important things.
</em></strong><br>If reading does not keep you alive and will take up a lot of your time, then it is more reasonable to spend your time on "survival".&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><em>2)Reading is not the only way to acquire knowledge.
</em></strong><br>It may be the best, most economical and most convenient way to acquire knowledge (this is just my opinion), but it is not irreplaceable and certainly suitable for you.
The era we live in is called the "<mark>digital age</mark>". There are not only words, but also speeches, podcasts, videos, VR, AR and so on.
Compared with words, pictorial knowledge is also easier for us to accept, more vivid and interesting, so is there any reason why they can't replace "reading"?
In addition, every kind of knowledge must have its most suitable way to acquire, reading is only one of these ways, in most cases is not the most suitable one.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><em>3)Reading is not the only way to get the best emotional experience.
</em></strong><br>One of my propositions is that if reading doesn't give people a good emotional experience, it's better not to read at all.
Of course, the "happiness" I'm talking about here is only one of the emotional experiences, and the reading process may be accompanied by pain, satisfaction, boredom, anger and other emotions.
So how do you define this "good emotional experience"?
<br>Are pain and anger "good"?
Maybe we should take into account what we think of as negative emotions.
Generally speaking, in the process of reading the novel, the reader's emotional experience will be very obvious, especially the type of novel whose plot is particularly attractive (martial arts, science fiction, romance, etc.). This kind of emotional fluctuation is normal in the process of reading. and the novel itself has the function of emotional catharsis, so is part of the purpose of the author's own creation.
But in this era, "fast food culture" often gives people a greater impact, so that people get emotional experience in a variety of ways, "fast-paced" way of life brings people a fast-paced emotional experience.
For example, we can temporarily get rid of the world and immerse ourselves in the ups and downs of the movie, and then pull it out, while reading is a kind of "slow work", which takes more time, obviously unable to meet people's "fast" needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Saying that "reading is something that should be done but does not need everyone to do" does not mean that I do not advocate reading. Reading is irreplaceable in obtaining a longer-term emotional experience, sharpening the mind and exercising the mind.
<br>I still remember the pleasure of immersing myself in the the pleasure of reading martial arts novels all night. I also remember the scene when I was fascinated by the video games when I was a child, but now people may be more impressed by video games. As far as emotions are concerned, there may be no difference, but in terms of ability improvement, it can only be said that "each has his own strengths".
<br>A good game is better than a good book, but it can't completely replace the good book (on the contrary), because the game is loose and real-time, and the book is tight and permanent.
<br>On the contrary, some games can help people improve their spatial cognitive ability, and most books can't do that.
This is also one of the reasons why reading is "unnecessary".
  </p>

    <h2 id="how-to-read-a-book">
      How to read a book?
    </h2>

  <p>
    The experience of our predecessors may be useful for reference, but it is not a day to develop reading habits and methods. Moreover, the books read by the ancients are different from those we read now, and there is no need to blindly copy them.
<br>Therefore, my opinion is that different methods should be used to read different types of books, and the method of reading should change with the purpose of reading.
<br>For example, reading social science and reading novels should adopt different reading methods, reading social science, focusing on acquiring new knowledge, so we need to take steps to capture the ideas and logic in the article, while reading novels, focusing on reading experience, should be as fast as the wind, immersed in it, aftertaste, aftertaste, aftertaste.
<br>In addition, although they are both reading novels, the reading methods of ordinary readers are certainly different from those of professional researchers. as mentioned earlier, ordinary readers do not pursue an in-depth analysis of the structure and thought of the novel, while the researchers are not. in the understanding of the novel as a whole, we should also "divide the novel into pieces" and carefully examine the details such as the logic of the development of the story and the shaping of characters.
<br>This is my personal experience, that is, you don't have to stick to the same method in reading.

                <h2>1. Continuously maintain high quality input</h2>
<p>I recall that when I first wrote, I sat in front of the computer, scratching my ear and scratching my cheek, and I didn't know how to write. In the final analysis, my stomach had too little "ink" to hold the literati. Less "ink" means we don't have enough input. <br>Input is like the inlet of a reservoir. Only by keeping a continuous supply of input can there be a continuous flow of output. Input and output is a complete closed loop. <br><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #3598db;"><em>So what are inputs and outputs? </em></span><br>What you hear, what you learn, what you see can be called input, and what you write and say can be called output. We usually read books, read articles is a kind of input, communicate with people, get new ideas and methods, these are also a kind of input. <br>Even what you see and hear during the journey, the new things you come into contact with, is also a kind of input. <br>For example, when I read books and read other people's articles, I will encounter some golden sentences, stories and cases; chat with friends, classmates and strangers, talk about good methods, new ideas, and desirable places. I will write down, accumulate more, collect more, organize more, absorb more, and internalize more. <br>In writing, when you encounter the right topic, you can sort it out and use it, which can not only make the content of the article appear lively and interesting, but also enrich the content, so that the whole article will not be full of our own stories, so that it will be written out in less than a few times. <br>For good methods, I will also practice and experience more deeply. This is a typical use of input and output. Only by insisting on self-knowledge input and integrating into one's own practice can we make these common principles more attractive and more persuasive when they are passed on to everyone. Readers are also more willing to accept, resonate, make changes, and take action.</p>
<h2>2.Writing should think carefully, improve the depth and highlight the novelty</h2>
<p>Writing is the process of expressing ideas in words, and the words you write are the crystallization of your thinking. If your brain is empty, no matter how good your writing skills are, you can only moan without illness. The point you think out is the soul of the article. The clearer you think, the clearer you can write. A profound article comes from deep thinking. <br>There are many writers now, and when you think of a point, many Daniel writers may have written it already. No matter how good you are, it is very difficult to stand out, because when readers go to see the big names, your reading volume and attention will naturally be less. <br>When writing, you can first go to the platform or the web to search for similar topics or articles, if there is already a particularly good one, then continue to think about the theme to avoid bumping into shirts and homogenizing content. <br>Want to scarce themes or ideas and perspectives are relatively "new". <br>There are two methods that can be used. <br><em><strong>1) the exclusion method of three-tier thinking. </strong></em><br>Is to face a subject, the first layer of thinking to think of a theme, and then think of the second, and then think hard back, until come up with a new point of view. <br><strong><em>2) the method of multi-angle observation of the same subject matter. </em></strong><br>Try to analyze it from different angles, for example, excellent movies will have a lot of reviews, and everyone will cut into different angles, and the effect will be different. These are all materials for us to learn. <br>Then how to improve their thinking ability, introduce several methods, are very easy to use. <br><em><strong>1) when you encounter anything, ask yourself a few more "why".</strong></em></p>
<p>When you were a child, when you encounter something, we always like to ask a lot of why. Later, we all grew up, a lot of things, our thinking is only on the surface, no longer want to ask why, gradually, we are too lazy to think. <br>For a writer, we should constantly ask ourselves "why", dig deeper, explore the truth, pursue the deepest thoughts, force ourselves to think, and pursue the origin of things. <br><strong><em>2) A4 paper brainstorming</em></strong><br>Take a minute to write down your thoughts on A4 paper. <br>Write down the topic you want to express on each piece of paper, write 4-6 lines on a page, 20-30 words on each line, and limit the time to one minute. <br>The way to do this is to quickly focus your attention and arouse your thoughts. <br>Long-term training can easily improve the ability of deep thinking. <br><strong><em>3) use the golden circle of thinking. </em></strong><br>The way we look at problems is divided into three levels. <br><strong>The first level</strong> is the what level, that is, the appearance of things, everything we do. <br><strong>The second level </strong>is the how level, that is, how we achieve what we want to do. <br><strong>The third level </strong>is the why level, which is why we do such things. <br>The most basic application of the golden circle of thinking is: when you encounter everything, you must first ask "why" in order to know what to do and what to do. For example, when you write, you must first think about "why you want to write". Only by thinking clearly about why can you have the motivation to continue to write. <br>We should develop the habit of asking why when solving problems, and do things from the beginning to the end. If you slowly develop this habit of thinking, you will grow and gain from anything, and the effect of this ability is the most frightening and amazing.</p>
<h2>3.Continuously improve writing skills.</h2>
<p>Writing is also a skill, it takes deliberate practice to make perfect, every writing is an exercise, every time reading other people's articles, dismantling the writing methods of other people's articles, is a kind of learning. <br>Novices usually not only have to study other people's excellent works, imitate and learn; on the other hand, they should start to write boldly. Only when they really write, can they have a chance to write better and better; they can also specialize in reading books to improve their writing skills in an all-round way. <br><span style="color: #3598db;"><strong>Write more and change more. </strong></span><br>If you write less, your brain will not live; if you change less, you will not be able to express clearly. You can also read relevant writing books about improving your writing skills. I recommend that I have read several books that have a great influence on me.</p>

      Indulge in things that are "easy to get a high sense of achievement"
    </h2>

  <p>
    Consciously or unintentionally seek a recipe for a great "return" with a small amount of effort, even if the reward is virtual. This kind of behavior will raise their own "excitement threshold", making people less and less likely to have a sense of achievement, thus relying more and more on a virtual sense of achievement and falling into a vicious circle.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    Mild symptoms:&nbsp;"addicted to games" (speeding up the passage of time in the virtual world, so that "success" comes faster), "stallion novels" (obscene people can easily get what they want);
  </p>

  <p>
    Serious symptoms and even illegal: gambling" (easy access to "money"), "drug abuse" (easy to get the feeling of "cool"), and so on.
  </p>

    <h2 id="only-receive-sources-with-low-information-densitynbsp">
      Only receive sources with "low information density"&nbsp;
    </h2>

  <p>
    Only willing to receive information with low information density (such as videos and pictures that do not need too much brainstorming, as well as shallow entertainment, gossip, sports news, etc.). Do not want to receive information with high information density and can only be absorbed after careful consideration (such as courses, knowledge frameworks, analytical reports, etc.).&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    Since most of the really valuable and progressive information needs to be considered and digested, it will not be possible to make progress without in-depth study and understanding.
  </p>

    <h2 id="get-used-to-paralyzing-yourself-with-a-sense-of-misplaced-achievement">
      Get used to paralyzing yourself with a sense of "misplaced achievement"
    </h2>

  <p>
    <br>There are two categories: first, compare your strengths with other people's weaknesses, so as to get the illusion of "better than others" (for example, compared with athletes, and high achiever compared with sports); second, when others are resting after serious work, pretend to work harder (for example, "show off" that you have done more work than others on holidays, but only on holidays).
  </p>

    <h2 id="overreliance-on-existing-feasible-paths">
      Over-reliance on "existing feasible paths"
    </h2>

  <p>
    At work, after getting used to the process of a thing, I never think about how to improve it. I will only repeat it mechanically, and then deceive myself to be full. If there is no improvement, there is no consciousness of getting rid of dross, so there are more and more things that need to be repeated and take longer and longer. in the end, it seems that a lot of things have been done every day, but in fact, there is not only no progress at all. the time of progress that should have been made is also wasted.
  </p>

    <h2 id="close-the-channel-of-reinforcement-learning">
      Close the channel of "reinforcement learning"
    </h2>

  <p>
    In learning or receiving information, you are only willing to perform the simplest first step, but are unwilling to carry out the next more complex consolidation and application process, only listening without speaking, reading without writing, learning without practice, and paralyzing yourself by saying that you have learned a lot. In fact, this kind of "shallow" learning forgets so quickly that sometimes it is better not to learn at all. For example, learn English every day, but never write English articles.

<p><span class="text-dst">According to scientists, when we encounter something we don't like or something very difficult, the brain secretes a special substance that makes you feel uncomfortable. </span><span class="text-dst">Then it naturally encourages you to focus on other things, and you procrastinate. </span></p>

<h2><span class="text-dst">To build a strong framework, you need two things, Chunking and Connecting</span></h2>
<p><span class="text-dst"><strong>Chunking</strong>, the knowledge we take in every day, like building bricks in a house, is independent. </span><span class="text-dst">If you want to build a house, you must have enough bricks, so it is necessary to learn all kinds of information.</span><span class="text-dst"> To build a house, you also need cement to connect these bricks. </span><span class="text-dst">This requires that every time you learn a knowledge, you should think about the causes and consequences of this knowledge, what are the rules, and so on.</span><br><span class="text-dst"><strong>Connecting</strong>, you will have the ability to innovate. </span><span class="text-dst">Because you can find a pattern in the connection of each small module. </span><span class="text-dst">Then as you have more and more connections and become more and more powerful, there will be more possibilities for connections. </span><span class="text-dst">The ability to innovate is coming.</span></p>
<h2><span class="text-dst hl">What to do when you need to learn something difficult</span></h2>
<p><span class="text-dst">First, if you need to learn something that is difficult,, don't focus on the results, enjoy the process. </span><span class="text-dst">Paying too much attention to the result will make you give up.</span><br><span class="text-dst">The second is to give yourself periodic rewards, which is very important. </span><span class="text-dst">Proper self-discipline is freedom, and excessive self-discipline is self-harm. </span><span class="text-dst">Your respect for human nature, respect for the nature of your brain, and a reward from time to time will make it easier for you to stick to it. </span><span class="text-dst">The interval between rewards should not be too long. </span><span class="text-dst">For example, if you lose weight for 5 days, you can eat freely; after 2 hours of homework, you can play with your cell phone for 10 minutes. After this reward, you are full of energy.</span><br><span class="text-dst">Third, believe in yourself and don't blame yourself all the time. </span><span class="text-dst">As long as this time is a little better than last time, it will be all right. </span><span class="text-dst">Of course, if it's not good once in a while, it doesn't matter, it's better next time.</span></p>
