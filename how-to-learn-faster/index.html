If you knock yourself to death in any mode, you are doing useless work.</span></strong></address><p><span class="text-dst"><strong>Focused mode</strong>: your brain is mainly learning, entering information, and doing information matching work. </span><span class="text-dst">It is usually started when we are working and studying.</span><br><span class="text-dst"><strong>Diffuse mode</strong>: your brain is doing internal analysis, generating new links, re-linking and kneading old knowledge. </span><span class="text-dst">This state is initiated when we sleep, exercise and other relaxed states. </span><span class="text-dst">Sometimes you have inspiration when you take a shower, and that's what this pattern does.</span></p><p><span class="text-dst"> To sum up, it is necessary to stop and play after studying for a period of time. </span><span class="text-dst">It's not laziness, but only in this way, your brain works most efficiently.</span></p><h2>Procrastination is normal</h2><p><span class="text-dst">According to scientists, when we encounter something we don't like or something very difficult, the brain secretes a special substance that makes you feel uncomfortable. </span><span class="text-dst">Then it naturally encourages you to focus on other things, and you procrastinate. </span></p><p><span class="text-dst">So, first of all, you have to know that procrastination is a normal human behavior, so don't blame yourself too much. </span></p><p><span class="text-dst">What are we going to do with it? </span><span class="text-dst">Our brains also have a magical function, that is, once you focus on a task for more than five minutes, this particular substance will stop secreting. </span><span class="text-dst">So the solution to doing unhappy things is to force yourself to start for five minutes, and then everything will be fine.</span></p><h2><span class="text-dst">About memory. </span></h2><address><strong><span class="text-dst">The content needs to be repeated constantly, and the higher the previous repetition frequency, the longer the memory will be preserved</span></strong></address><p><span class="text-dst">Which of the following ways can achieve a better and faster memory effect if you want to remember a poem?</span><br><span class="text-dst"><strong>A</strong> memorize over 20 times a day.</span><br><span class="text-dst"><strong>B</strong> recite 10 times on the first day, 5 times on the second day, and 5 times on the 4th day.</span><br><span class="text-dst">The answer is <strong>B. </strong></span><span class="text-dst">Because memory is divided into <strong>short-term memory</strong> and<strong> long-term memory</strong>, the way to convert short-term memory into long-term memory is to repeat over a period of time, rather than one at a time.</span></p><h2 class="textpanel-source active"><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;">Sleep is a magic weapon that can make you smarter</span></h2><p><span class="text-dst">What are our brains doing while we sleep?</span><br><span class="text-dst">1. Clean up the garbage secretions produced by heavy exercise during the day.</span><br><span class="text-dst">2. Reorganize the information entered during the day, classify them and re-link them. </span><span class="text-dst">Suppose the brain is a large cabinet with many drawers, and the large amount of information entered during the day is like all kinds of things that have just been bought. </span><span class="text-dst">After going to bed at night, the brain classifies these things into various drawers one by one, so that you can use them later.</span><br><span class="text-dst">3. Strengthen the link between new knowledge and old knowledge, and subconsciously keep thinking about the problems that have not been solved during the day. </span><span class="text-dst">The most important thing is that these movements can only be done during sleep, so sleep is really an important task.</span></p><h2><span class="text-dst">To build a strong framework, you need two things, Chunking and Connecting</span></h2><p><span class="text-dst"><strong>Chunking</strong>, the knowledge we take in every day, like building bricks in a house, is independent. </span><span class="text-dst">If you want to build a house, you must have enough bricks, so it is necessary to learn all kinds of information.</span><span class="text-dst"> To build a house, you also need cement to connect these bricks. </span><span class="text-dst">This requires that every time you learn a knowledge, you should think about the causes and consequences of this knowledge, what are the rules, and so on.</span><br><span class="text-dst"><strong>Connecting</strong>, you will have the ability to innovate. </span><span class="text-dst">Because you can find a pattern in the connection of each small module. </span><span class="text-dst">Then as you have more and more connections and become more and more powerful, there will be more possibilities for connections. </span><span class="text-dst">The ability to innovate is coming.</span></p><h2><span class="text-dst hl">What to do when you need to learn something difficult</span></h2><p><span class="text-dst">First, if you need to learn something that is difficult,, don't focus on the results, enjoy the process. </span><span class="text-dst">Paying too much attention to the result will make you give up.</span><br><span class="text-dst">The second is to give yourself periodic rewards, which is very important. </span><span class="text-dst">Proper self-discipline is freedom, and excessive self-discipline is self-harm. </span><span class="text-dst">Your respect for human nature, respect for the nature of your brain, and a reward from time to time will make it easier for you to stick to it. </span><span class="text-dst">The interval between rewards should not be too long. </span><span class="text-dst">For example, if you lose weight for 5 days, you can eat freely; after 2 hours of homework, you can play with your cell phone for 10 minutes. After this reward, you are full of energy.</span><br><span class="text-dst">Third, believe in yourself and don't blame yourself all the time. </span><span class="text-dst">As long as this time is a little better than last time, it will be all right. </span><span class="text-dst">Of course, if it's not good once in a while, it doesn't matter, it's better next time.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 29, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/tags/study/">Study</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/get-rid-of-the-following-five-misunderstandings-and-you-will-make-progress-faster/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Get rid of the following five misunderstandings, and you will make progress faster </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>CopyRight © 2021 notelism</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://litenotes.github.io/publii/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
