But the fun and benefits of reading are relatively advanced, it is difficult to directly or easily show in front of us, but requires a process of reading accumulation and precipitation.Therefore, to develop good reading habits and persist in reading is a thing worth our time and energy to cultivate and do.</p><h2 id="1-make-a-list-and-make-a-plan">1. Make a list and make a plan.</h2><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: think about which books you are interested in, which books (knowledge) you urgently need, and which are good for you. If you can't find a book, the easiest way is to find someone to recommend it or search the Internet based on keywords.<br><strong>Step 2</strong>: make a list of books for yourself according to the first step, usually in years or months.<br><strong>Step 3</strong>: incorporate the book list into your reading plan, that is, what books you want to read each month, how much time you spend reading or how much you read each day. Make a table and post it in a conspicuous place (you can use a colored pen to make this reading schedule creatively).<br><strong>Step 4</strong>: put the books you want to read that day in the ready, on the desk and other places.<br>This will serve as a reminder to prevent you from forgetting or procrastinating again and again.</p><h2 id="2-from-shallow-to-deep-from-simple-to-complex">2. From shallow to deep, from simple to complex</h2><p>Many of us always overestimate our abilities, which is reflected in the fact that we have bought a lot of books, but very few of us have actually finished or read them. One of the big reasons is that the selected books are higher than their own reading level, it is difficult to read, and slowly they lose interest.</p><p>In the matter of reading, don't aim too high at the beginning and choose books that are very heavy and difficult to understand, resulting in less and less interest in reading. You should first choose books that are easy to read and easy to understand, and then wait until you have some foundation, and then step by step to read books that are more difficult on the same subject. In fact, in every topic, there will be relatively simple and advanced books. Before you have a foundation, start with simple or interesting books.</p><h2 id="3-improve-reading-skills">3. Improve reading skills.</h2><p>If you want to develop good reading habits and enjoy the benefits and fun of reading, it is necessary to learn and master some reading skills. There are a lot of detailed reading skills, many of which have been taught by teachers at school, so here are just a few:</p><p>1) when reading, focus on the main contents and related arguments of each paragraph. When reading, use a pencil to draw notes and mark the key points of each paragraph, which also helps to improve your reading ability.</p><p>2) when you encounter words and opinions that you don't understand in reading, don't look it up in the dictionary or look up the materials. You can contact the sentence before and after, or try to understand it in context, which is helpful to improve your reading and thinking ability.</p><p>3) Train your ability of fast reading.This does not mean that you should have a reading speed of tens of thousands of words per minute. The key is to change your traditional word-by-word reading habits and improve your reading efficiency. Because reading slowly word by word, not only the reading speed is slow, but also its comprehension rate is not high.</p><p>The focus of the training of fast reading method is to activate our "brain and eye" potential, and to cultivate a reading learning style of eye-brain direct reflection. Not to mention those great gods who count at a glance, as long as we ordinary people train consciously and read 5-10 words at a glance, everyone can easily master it.</p><p>4) To understand a book from multiple angles. Everyone will be limited by their own knowledge structure, ability and other factors, when reading, they can only read and understand a book from the level closest to them. For good books, there are generally a lot of comments and understanding of big V or celebrities online, or articles, books, or videos, explanations, might as well listen to their views.</p><h2 id="4-reading-and-writing-are-not-separated-writing-strengthens-reading-and-promotes-reading">4. Reading and writing are not separated. Writing strengthens reading and promotes reading.</h2><p><strong>Consolidate reading</strong>: after reading a book, or just a part of it, and then write about your understanding and perception after reading, even if it is just a simple reading style writing, you can further understand and master what you are reading.</p><p><strong>Promote reading</strong>: when you need or want to write an article on a topic, in order to write better, you will flip through some books and materials related to the topic, which virtually urges you to read. and eventually form a virtuous circle. On the other hand, sharing what you write will encourage you to continue reading and writing.</p><h2 id="5-integrate-reading-into-daily-life">5. Integrate reading into daily life</h2><p>First of all, provide yourself with a suitable place to read. If you live around a library and other places suitable for reading, it is best to feel more. If not, it doesn't matter. Discover or create a place for reading on your own.</p><p>Second, Make good use of your mobile phone, read e-books through your mobile phone, and excellent articles, all of which will increase your reading ability.</p><p>In addition, you can also organize your own family and friends to participate in reading and share the fun and harvest of reading.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 30, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://notelism.com/tags/reading/">Reading</a></li><li><a href="https://notelism.com/tags/study/">Study</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://notelism.com/using-the-pyramid-principle-to-write-a-good-article/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Using the pyramid principle to write a good article</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://notelism.com/how-to-read-effectively/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How to read effectively </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-30T23:03" class="feed__date">April 30, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://notelism.com/how-to-read-effectively/" class="invert">How to read effectively</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-30T16:54" class="feed__date">April 30, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://notelism.com/using-the-pyramid-principle-to-write-a-good-article/" class="invert">Using the pyramid principle to write a good article</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-30T10:18" class="feed__date">April 30, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://notelism.com/about-reading/" class="invert">About Reading</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>CopyRight © 2021 notelism</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://notelism.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
